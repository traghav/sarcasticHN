"A lot of people here don&#x27;t quite seem to get what this is all about.<p>Previously, a PC or a console might have 4-8 cores (or hyperthreads, or cell processors, or whatever). Typically, you&#x27;d want to be doing sequential I&#x2F;O from just one of those processor cores, because more than likely be a mechanical disk. At <i>most</i> you could do asynchronous or threaded I&#x2F;O so that the CPU core could also do other computation while waiting for textures to stream in (or whatever), but that&#x27;s about it.<p>More than one concurrent I&#x2F;O at a time (even from other programs!) would cause the disk head to seek, killing your performance. You&#x27;d get stuttering in the game or texture popping as the I&#x2F;O fell behind. You could budget on <i>maybe</i> 20-30 MB&#x2F;s if you&#x27;re lucky, or less than 5 MB&#x2F;s random I&#x2F;O if unlucky.<p><i>It made no difference if you had a PC with an SSD, as zero games were written for it.</i><p>So now, with SSDs in consoles as standard you would automatically assume, that we can finally utilise all the CPU threads and throw 8 cores worth of I&#x2F;O at the SSD. Maybe increase the queue depth a bit more, have some asynchronous and overlapped I&#x2F;Os or something.<p>But that&#x27;s <i>crazy difficult</i>. The models and textures being streamed in are actually <i>used</i> on the GPU, not the CPU. Each texture is typically mip-mapped, building up a &quot;pyramid&quot; of lower and lower resolution versions to prevent moire when viewed at a distance. The &quot;currently used set&quot; of each texture is a complicated angled &#x27;slice&#x27; through this sort-of-3D texture &#x27;volume&#x27;! This is used asynchronously by the GPU, and ideally you&#x27;d somehow want to track this, figuring out which parts are used by the GPU, which aren&#x27;t, from which mip-map layer, etc.. and then <i>predict ahead</i> the next set of 32x32 tiles or whatever you&#x27;d want to load. In parallel. Across 8 CPU cores. While the GPU is doing its own thing.<p>Just no. That&#x27;s not happening. The synchronisation alone would be a nightmare. It&#x27;s crazy talk. No human can write code like this, and certainly not optimally <i>and</i> efficiently.<p>So the brilliant thing about the GPU on the PS5 is that the GPU can make direct I&#x2F;O calls. No CPU involvement. Whatever it &quot;needs&quot;, as and when it decides, it can simply directly fetch.<p>It&#x27;s not going to do this with 8 cores, or 16 threads. No, it&#x27;s going to do it with <i>thousands</i> of cores. The I&#x2F;O queue depths that used to be &quot;exactly 1&quot; for literally 100% of all previous games are not going to be 8. They&#x27;re going to be tens of thousands! This is massive. This isn&#x27;t &quot;a couple of random I&#x2F;Os done a little bit better&quot;, it&#x27;s <i>four or five orders of magnitude</i>."

"Nope, the new fiber will be high dispersion compared to the old fiber and also will not have dispersion compensation along its length.  The old cable was designed for OOK signaling.  Previously optical signaling was 1 bit per symbol OOK (on-off-keying) and direct detection meaning you did not have any optical phase information to make dispersion corrections so the dispersion compensation was done in a specially designed fiber with the opposite sign slope for dispersion (DCF).<p>This fiber was also relatively high loss and has a narrower core which leads to higher nonlinearities in the link.  The old cable tries to keep the dispersion within the range that OOK technologies can operate error-free (post FEC) so there&#x27;s a lot of it typical at each repeater (EDFA).  The newer coherent optical technology can transmit multiple bits per symbol (BPSK, QPSK) by encoding the bits in the optical phase.  Since the phase is recovered at the receiver the dispersion accumulated in the fiber can be undone in DSP with a long enough FIR filter.  So the need for dispersion compensation is gone with coherent optical.  Taking out the DCF also reduces loss along the link reducing EDFA (amplifier) count and increasing spacing.  Also nonlinear penalties on the newer higher dispersion fiber are lower which improves something called cycle slips that can punch through the FEC and cause you to take post-FEC errors.<p>The net result is that you should be able to transmit QPSK at 32GBd in 2 polarizations in maybe 80 waves in each direction.<p>2bits x 2 polarizations x 32G ~128Gb&#x2F;s per wave or nearly 11Tb&#x2F;s for 1 fiber.  If this cable has 6 strands, then it could easily meet the target transmission capacity."

I tried to point out some of the perceived flaws of SpaceMonkey in my post.<p>A specific problem is that the ability to copy files with LAN speed to the device turned out to be true only for small files. If you have gigabytes of files you can mount it as a network drive in linux and have around 32MB&#x2F;s write speed.<p>On Windows and Mac the client will cache files in a temp folder and copy the to the device. So you can&#x27;t just unplug your laptop and leave immediately but have to wait for the sync to finish … that is some functionality they promised in the kickstarter campaign.<p>And I experienced problems with the offline mode where you are supposed to use the SpaceMonkey network to retrieve your files if your device is offline. This didn&#x27;t work in my case.

"Yes, comcast threw tantrums in city hall on multiple occasions.<p>Longmont&#x27;s story is rather complicated and interesting. I don&#x27;t know all the details, but knew a fair number of the key players. Essentially, Longmont allowed an upstart ISP to put cable in the ground. Part of the deal was that if they were going to sell it, Longmont got first right of refusal (or something similar), and when they went under, the city bought the fiber for cheap. They were sitting on dark fiber for a long time, and they leased it out to several companies who failed to make it work. Then, after enough people in the town and city government cared (I&#x27;ll call out Jim Wall - the town CTO - for being awesome), the vote passed and with some creaking and groaning, the roll-out got started. Residents got 1 Gigabit symmetric for $50 per month (you&#x27;re reading that correctly).<p>Interestingly, nearly overnight, both Comcast and Charter were offering more than 1 Gb&#x2F;s for $75ish."

"&gt; <i>CIA drone strikes all over the world</i><p>The US is known to have carried out drone strikes in Afghanistan, Yemen (including against US citizens), Pakistan, Libya, and Somalia; authority over the assassination program was officially transferred from the CIA to the military by Obama.  That leaves another 200-plus countries whose citizens do not yet know the feeling of helpless terror when the car in front of you on the highway explodes into a fireball unexpectedly, presaged only by the far-off ripping sound of a Reaper on the horizon, just like most days.  The smaller drones that make this tactic affordable to a wider range of groups will give no such warning.<p>&gt; <i>It’s much easier to defend soldiers against tiny drones than against heavy fire.</i><p>Daesh used tiny drones against soldiers with some effectiveness, but there are several major differences between autonomous drones and heavy fire.  First, heavy fire is expensive, requiring either heavy weapons or a large number of small arms.  Second, <i>autonomous</i> drones (which Daesh evidently did not have) can travel a lot farther than heavy fire; the attacker can target the soldiers’ families in another city rather than the soldiers themselves, and even if they are targeting the soldiers directly, they do not need to expose themselves to counterattack from the soldiers.  Third, almost all bullets miss, but autonomous drones hardly ever need to miss; like a sniper, they can plan for one shot, one kill.<p>You may be thinking of the 5 m&#x2F;s quadcopters shown in the Slaughterbots video, but there’s no reason for drones to move that slowly.  Slingshot stones, arrows from bows, and bottle-rockets all move on the order of 100 m&#x2F;s, and you can stick guidance canards on any of them, VAPP-style.<p>&gt; <i>If you don’t know who your enemy is, say terrorists mixed in the crowd of civilians, how would face detection help you?</i><p>Yes, it’s true that if your enemy is protected by anonymity, face-recognition drones are less than useful — that’s why the first step in my scenario is the end of any government transparency, because the only people who can govern in that scenario (in the Westphalian sense of applying deadly force with impunity) are anonymous terrorists.  But if the terrorists know who their victims are, the victims cannot protect themselves by mixing into a crowd of civilians.<p>&gt; <i>Yes, terrorists and evil governments will keep murdering people just like they always have. No, this technology does not make it fundamentally easier.</i><p>Well, on the battlefield it definitely will drive down the cost per kill, even though it hasn’t yet.  It’s plausible to think that it will drive down the cost per kill in scenarios of mass political killing, as I described above, but you might be right that it won’t.<p>The two <i>really</i> big changes, though, are not about making killing <i>easier</i>, but about making killing <i>more persuasive</i>, for two reasons. ① It allows the killing to be precisely focused on the desired target, for example enabling armies to kill <i>only</i> the officers of the opposing forces, <i>only</i> the men in a city, or <i>only</i> the workers at a munitions plant, rather than everybody within three kilometers; ② it allows the killing to be truly borderless, so that it’s very nearly as easy to kill the officers’ families as to kill the officers — but only the officers who refuse to surrender.<p>You say “evil governments”, but killing people to break their will to continue to struggle is not limited to some subset of governments; it is the fundamental way that governments retain power in the face of the threat of invasion.<p>Covering a city with nets is surprisingly practical, given modern materials like Dyneema and Zylon, but not effective against all kinds of drones.  I agree that underground fortresses and off-planet camps cannot save very many people, but perhaps they can preserve some seed of human civilization."
"See, now this is an enjoyable fact. It is interesting to think that all of the forces involved in the collision will finish propelling themselves into each other within 2 minutes.

Maybe today&#x27;s analogue would be to give a smartphone a full reservation of a current supercomputer with 50 PFLOP&#x2F;s and see what kind of application one could do by using computations on the phone&#x27;s sensor? I&#x27;d imagine something AR related could be interesting, or applying some kind of NN training within seconds that would not be feasible on a phone today. Maybe throw in a quantum computer once supremacy over classical is achieved in some areas (which appears to be pretty close now, sidenote)."
"Even for built systems the cost of ownership and maintenance will grow as the system grows. Take the logging example above and say you&#x27;re using the Elastic Stack. Things are going pretty well and usage is increasing. Over time your system grows and logging is now present in all of your applications. You&#x27;ve seen your logging rate go from 100 logs&#x2F;s, to 1,000 logs&#x2F;s, to 10,000 logs&#x2F;s and now are encroaching the 100,000 logs&#x2F;s rate. Over time the amount it cost to host your ES cluster has surely gone up. You probably went from a single node cluster when developing the solution, to a multi-node cluster, to now a hot-warm-cold cluster with several more nodes than you originally had. You also have a dedicated team making sure your in-house logging solution is working and stable. The cost of ownership and maintenance of this system is real. Not only do you need to pay for the huge clusters you&#x27;ll likely have a dedicated team supporting it. Most people I&#x27;ve talked to in the industry don&#x27;t like maintaining their in-house logging solutions and would gladly pay for one if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that it was too expensive to switch then. Because you need specialized people that know this logging solution it&#x27;s also hard to hire for this role when the person currently maintaining this system eventually leaves (because he doesn&#x27;t want to do this anymore). At the end of the day it&#x27;s cheaper to pay for a logging solution even if it&#x27;s in the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year than it is to build your own."

"If you actually intend to serve traffic back to the original requestor, you can&#x27;t have too many requests handled per server because you have a limited amount of bandwidth.  150 requests per server on a 1Gbps pipe (which is what you get on, for instance, a single ELB instance) only actually gives you about  813 KB&#x2F;s per request for 150 requests&#x2F;server.  For 10,000 requests you&#x27;d be down to 12 KB&#x2F;s per request.  For comparison, the <i>average</i> web page size is now up to 2048 KB!<p>To be clear, you can do a lot better with a better pipe, smart caching, compression, etc.  But people often have horribly unrealistic estimates about how much traffic their servers can handle because they don&#x27;t take bandwidth into account, and load balancers are no exception."

It may be <i>easier</i> to scale (especially autoscale), but, with cloud providers, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean cheaper. In practice, distributed computing never scales as good as linearly, and people tend not to even measure for diminishing returns or how Amdahl&#x27;s Law affects them.<p>&gt;  It could also be conceivable cheaper if you’re doing non time sensitive online analytics processing instead of something that requires a real time response.<p>I believe GCP has instituted single-instance pricing that&#x27;s essentially pay-what-you-use in terms of number of cores, so that&#x27;s even possible with a database server on <i>that</i> provider, but, again, only if the issue is CPU, which I maintain it generally isn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; Also, when scaling up a database, there is more of a potential for wasting money because of idle capacity when the resources aren’t needed.<p>I recall this sort of thing being the original argument for virtualization, when it first came out, but it only held water if one was grossly over-paying for the resources to begin with (which most &quot;enterprise&quot; shops certainly were, and still are).<p>To me, it&#x27;s an argument for why, beyond modest size, buying cloud infrastructure is just over-paying.<p>&gt; paying for extra read and write capacity gets expensive<p>&gt; Serverless Aurora that auto scales but it would also get really expensive fast<p>Par for the course for any cloud services, in that they may seem convenient or &quot;auto scale&quot; but the price premium is tremendous, especially <i>at</i> scale.

I doubt this was an option for orbital sciences to use in their rockets.<p>The NK33, which is the soviet engine that was used, has a twr of 137 and an I_sp at sea level of 2.91 km&#x2F;s.<p>The atlas V rockets by boeing and lockheed use an rd180, also russian built btw, which has a twr of 78.44 and an I_sp at sea level of 3.05 km&#x2F;s.<p>The delta IV rockets by boeing us an rs68 or rs68a have a twr of 51.2 and an I_sp of 3.58 km&#x2F;s. I&#x27;m not sure if these are available for commercial use, though, since boeing shut down the commercial delta IV launch program. The US military still uses them though, so they are still being produced. Also, these use liquid hydrogen instead of RP1 (rocket grade kerosine) like all the rest of the engines here.<p>The Saturn V used five F1 engines (also 1960s tech, but no longer available).

"&gt; Smartphones were a new market.<p>New-ness doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is perf&#x2F;features and audience.

It&#x27;s the web.<p>&gt; Hahahahaha this is a bad joke, right?<p>It&#x27;s not a bad joke. This sort of condescension does not help persuade people.

But again, the studios will be happy to make some trade-offs here, so expect asset sizes to be smaller (akin to big smartphone).<p>&gt; And if networks are that robust, then why wouldn&#x27;t we just all jump on game streaming instead and embrace the thin client life?<p>Yep, agreed here. I was going to mention this at the end of my comment but it was getting too long. This definitely could be the &quot;dark horse&quot; which makes AAA web-platform gaming irrelevant.

"Depending on how source programs are split up into files, parsing can be easily parallelized (think one thread per file), while other compilation tasks are harder due to interdependencies. E.g. semantic analysis requires building type representations, global namespaces, etc. Code generation is (usually) parallelizable as well, but there are a couple very serial steps in the middle, too.<p>My experience is that parsers for source languages can reach into the 1-10mb&#x2F;s range, and depending on how complex the IRs and transformations are after that, code generation is usually around 0.5mb-5mb&#x2F;s. The stuff in the middle (dealing with IRs) is harder to measure in terms of bytes."

Using a single ephemeral instance with request&#x2F;response mechanics as a kind of load balancer for messages.

You want to go to Jupiter&#x27;s trojans or so, or maybe just Ceres if you&#x27;re willing to deal with its gravity well and dig a bit.

"BT is a multi billion dollar company, not to mention that sharesave isn&#x27;t the same as an equity compensation.<p>Share As You Earn SAYE is a savings plan in the UK which allows employees to save money from their salary in company shares.<p>The UK has really weird schemes because people have historically had no pension or savings plans from their employees (most PAYE workers still do not have pension as the date mandated by law is always being deferred).<p>With SAYE as far as i know the employer is not allowed to grant you equity, what they can do is give a fixed yearly rate (usually heavily discounted) for share purchases, but it&#x27;s not as sweet as it seems.
The dividends and the equity rights from the shares belong to the employer not the employee, this is basically a way to allow employers issue shares (in large volumes) without losing control over the company, having to do payouts, and decreasing the market value of their normal shares as SAYE shares are not tradeable.<p>It also allows employers to bypass various laws preventing normal employees from having too high of a share of the company, and ties employees to their employer since not only do they rely on it for their salary but also as their investment&#x2F;savings provider and since SAYE plans are either 5 or 3 years long it pretty much means that invested employees will not living the company during the SAYE period unless they want to lose their investment (and yes they will lose it).<p>BT&#x27;s Sharesave is also a &quot;unicorn&quot; and from the current buy-in value it will probably won&#x27;t repeat it self, yes a few people who saved up the max amount (225 GBP a month) gotten about 80K in return.

The money you gain for SAYE Isn&#x27;t tax free you pay capital gains tax on it if you sell them once they are matured.<p>Also since SAYE with all of it&#x27;s bells and whistles is a company options plan (with heavy tax incentives to the employer) it&#x27;s still a risk, some people got huge returns others didn&#x27;t since the share price was lower than the option price."

"It&#x27;s greatly improved with XBMC 13.0+, which included a bunch of optimizations to make XBMC on the RPi more bearable.

It also helps to use rpi-config and select the modest overclocking option (the one that doesn&#x27;t change any voltages). XBMC is very smooth after doing those things.<p>The only issue I still have is that the wifi dongle I attached to the RPi can only pull 10Mb&#x2F;s. I hear this is due to lack of power provided by the RPi to its USB ports and that it can be mitigated by using a powered USB hub, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. 10Mb&#x2F;s is enough to stream SD and some HD, but not all HD.

"Second stage recovery is a whole different beast. Recovering the first stage on a flight like this is a delicate dance because margins are so small, so everything has to go <i>exactly</i> right. The previous attempt (SES-9) didn&#x27;t quite go exactly right, and made a big boom, perhaps because the engine burns were slightly mistimed.<p>Recovering the <i>second</i> stage is difficult because it&#x27;s coming in from a much higher speed. The first stage came in doing about 2km&#x2F;s. The second stage would come in doing 8km&#x2F;s or more. That means 16x more kinetic energy to deal with and 64x more heating. You need a proper heat shield, not just clever engine burns. There&#x27;s much less extra margin to play with as well. The second stage does most of the work but is much lighter, and one pound on the second stage is worth ten pounds on the first stage.<p>SpaceX definitely believes second stage recovery to be feasible at some point, but not on the current Falcon 9."

"I did some time series data benchmarking recently. Most large data is &quot;time series&quot; data, but I will not digress on terminology right now. For the usecase I was looking at my results for InfluxDB did not qualitatively disagree the above blogpost. Timescale got better compression efficiency, faster query results, more constrained memory usage, but lower ingest speed at high concurrencies blocked by WAL insert locking and single threaded compression. If InfluxDBs measurement oriented data model and query interface is a good fit for your use case, and you don&#x27;t have high cardinality data, then it might be convenient to use it, but it&#x27;s a terrible choice for anything outside its niche.<p>However none of the databases tested above is anywhere close to the efficiency of a column store database that can do vectorized execution over batches of rows. ClickHouse is a good example of one such database. For queries that have to shift through large amounts of data, either filtering or aggregating it, the performance difference is easily &gt;10x. I was seeing aggregation performance above 2B rows&#x2F;s and that was I&#x2F;O throughput bound."
"Sadly, the tolerances are as inhumanly small as they stated. The intuition is that the fractional change in orbital period will equal the fractional change in orbital speed (times 3, but we&#x27;re only interested in orders of magnitude).<p>Thus, in low earth orbit, at a speed of 8000 m&#x2F;s, a relative speed of 8 mm&#x2F;s is a fractional change of 1 in 1 million. The orbital period is 90 minutes, a millionth of which is half a second. That doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but objects in orbit move really, really fast. Arriving at the same spot half a second later means you&#x27;ll miss the other object by 4 kilometers! Without active guidance, a rendezvous in orbit is near impossible."

"I used to believe this too, but not anymore.  High transactions fees and slow times are a problem, but increasing the blocksize is not the answer.  BTC can currently process 7 tx&#x2F;second with 1mb blocks.  If you double the block size, you get to 14 tx&#x2F;s, it scales linearly.  PayPal processes ~150 tx&#x2F;s, Visa processes ~5000 tx&#x2F;s, and can burst up to 50k tx&#x2F;s.  This is orders of magnitude off, and would require scaling blocks up to 1GB.  By setting the precedent that increasing blocksize is the answer to slow transactions, you open the door to a future where only a very limited number of powerful entities can afford to run a full node, which brings you right back to a centralized currency.  In order to scale BTC, it basically needs to move to off-chain transactions or some other new tech.  The devs know this, they want fast transactions too, but they don&#x27;t want to risk centralization to get there.<p>&gt; they can always lower it later<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true.  Once you have blocks on the chain greater than 1mb, those blocks must be valid forever.  That means protocol must support new blocksize forever."

Much better prices are available with some elbow grease applied.

"It only takes 1.87 km&#x2F;s to get from the moon&#x27;s surface to LLO, and there&#x27;s fuel and science and real estate at the bottom. The delta-V budget of, say, LLO to the nearest Earth-Moon Lagrangian point is about 1 km&#x2F;s.

"A rough estimate for using spot instances on EC2 says you can get maybe 40 trillion SHA1 hashes per dollar.

A million dollars will crack a password 10 characters long.<p>Switch to bcrypt and you&#x27;re now at 25 million hashes per dollar on those same instances.  Now you can barely crack passwords that are 4 characters long, or for a million dollars you get 7 characters.<p>That&#x27;s if you know the salt, of course.  Otherwise that gets added on to the length you&#x27;re cracking.<p>None of this is very exact but it gets you in the right ballpark.

"I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x2F;O over PCIe is a substantial bottleneck in many applications (which is part of the reason for the 300GB&#x2F;s POWER9 &#x2F; OpenCAPI &#x2F; NVLink &#x2F; GPUs). Its a shame that NVLink is isolated to pretty much the DGX-line of computers and POWER9 (The &quot;big&quot; ones too, I don&#x27;t think Talos II supports NVLink). But I guess an interconnect that fast will require dedicated, non-standard hardware.<p>----------<p>AMD&#x27;s GPU Infinity Fabric seems to be a different infinity fabric from their CPU. CPU Infinity Fabric is ~50GB&#x2F;s, but the GPU Infinity Fabric is GPU-to-GPU links of ~90GB&#x2F;s.<p>Realistically, PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 will be the path forward for standard PCs. There will always be incredible application-specific solutions (such as NVLink &#x2F; NVSwitch on the DGX), but the general computer user will wait for the open standards to support such speeds before adopting them.<p>At the moment, GPU-to-GPU communications probably will scale better than CPU-to-GPU comms. CPUs just aren&#x27;t built for the bandwidth (outside of POWER9 &#x2F; POWER10)."

"The 7.7s to process a 400KB page (Wikipedia) is particularly surprising.

"TLB is only an indirect cause. This is because kernel scheduler preempts processes fairly infrequently (100 or 1000hz, or dynamic, but still capped to a small number).<p>Scheduling quantums are so large precisely to keep TLB flush overhead of a context switch low. If a network mandates more interaction (say, 100k req&#x2F;s across all workers), each quantum tick must process a queued bundle of 1000 requests which piled up while asleep. This works as designed - you&#x27;re supposed to use up all of your quantum, and not terminate it early by issuing blocking IO per request. One prerequisite for this is that your network&#x2F;disk protocol <i>must</i> be pipelineable (most are because thats how we deal with network&#x2F;seek latencies).<p>But at certain point the overhead of this pipelining itself becomes so great (message queues too deep) you have to switch to threading.<p>Hardcore threading advocates on the other hand, need to account for overhead of atomics (for locking, or for &quot;lockless&quot; algorithms). An atomic must wait for all pending writeback flush. Threading gets a lot of bad rep not because &quot;kernels suck at it&quot;, but because person making such a statement wrote their program as an exercise in lock contention and&#x2F;or too much write cache pollution per single atomic.<p>Threading vs process tradeoff = deep pipeline overhead vs frequent queue flush+locking overhead tradeoff.<p>Typically, you need to meet somewhere in the middle for best performance, which is when you end up with threads with job queues - those basically emulate process-induced queues within thread model."

"From what I understand you can see a decent improvement in speed by going 64bit on ARM because they used the crossover to dump a fair bit of legacy braindamage in the instruction set that was preventing them from making certain optimizations.<p>On the other hand, I look at the 3000 core figure and think that it&#x27;s roughly on par with high end GPUs.  The clock rates aren&#x27;t terribly different either.  The range of applications where this beats out GPU solutions is probably fairly narrow, especially given the terrible IO bottleneck on the RPis.<p>For comparison, a $7,500 TITAN X has 3072 CUDA cores clocked at 1Ghz.  This cluster has 3,000 CPU cores clocked at 1.2Ghz.  On the TITAN card all of those cores share the same 12GB of memory with 336.5GB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth.  On the cluster every 4 cores shares 1GB of memory with (I think) 3.6GB&#x2F;s bandwidth.  Of course communication outside of those 4 cores is restricted to 0.0125GB&#x2F;s at best."

More cpu use but honestly, it would be stalled waiting on i&#x2F;o otherwise.<p>The key is the data sent to the cpu and decompressed, makes up for the stall from hitting memory or i&#x2F;o. Comparing ram vs ssd is the wrong comparison to make, with both you&#x27;re hitting stalls due to memory. You want to compare reads of uncompressed versus compressed with the note that (and i&#x27;m just making numbers up with this analogy as i&#x27;m about to sleep), 900KiB of compressed data in, 2MiB of data out. 1.1MiB bonus and yes I&#x27;m assuming huge compression but for times your cpu is idle it makes perfect sense.<p>And yes, lz4 compression on things like movies still helps.

"Several years ago I joined a stealth-mode spinoff of a large telecom equipment manufacturer, and worked on deep-packet inspection (DPI) on 10Gb&#x2F;s fiber-optic networks. The initial motivation for the project was a desire by telecom companies to obtain personally identifiable information and profiles for targeted advertising, and as we learned, a number of other interesting use cases, like reducing customer churn. At the NOCs there were a number of various servers in racks that were getting a feed of raw traffic for a variety of purposes. It wasn&#x27;t a free-for-all, but it was eye-opening. I recall reading through a Cisco router manual for example (not the company I worked for) and seeing its port-mirroring capabilities blatantly promoted as a means for customer profiling and targeted advertising.<p>Outside of the telecom industry itself there was quite a bit of resistance to this sort of thing, and we had to go before the US Congress to explain what we were up to. Profiling for the sake of profiling was not smooth sailing, but if it was for the purpose of &quot;security&quot; then it was more or less a free pass. The forcus of our DPI technology turned to the task of network-based threat detection as its primary raison d&#x27;être, with customer profiling being an opt-in service by which users could obtain the security service in exchange for targeted ads.<p>In the years since, I don&#x27;t expect that Telecom&#x27;s desire to be much more than a &quot;dumb pipe&quot; has diminished in the least. They view the traffic they carry on their networks to be their property, in a way. They feel entitled to inspect it, throttle it, slice and dice it any conceivable way they can to maximise their profits. Its one of the reasons I quit.<p>Imagine the US postal service steaming open every letter and opening every package that went through their system, so they could plug your mailbox with targeted special offers or increase the delivery fees for certain things. Its all similar BS with ISPs, but it&#x27;s all techie stuff and heavily lobbied so the public gets bamboozled.<p>You raise a really good point about wide-spread encryption being an impediment to ISP profiling. But there is a LOT you can surmise from user traffic even if you don&#x27;t know the exact content of the encrypted payloads. Just analyzing IP addresses and times can reveal a ton of information about a person. My first patent [US20100161795] was in fact a NAT session detection and tracking technique to identify and track individual users within a household through TCP&#x2F;IP analysis. Using this technique someone <i>could</i> get a pretty clear picture of how many people were in a household, their ages, genders, interests and patterns of activity, even without delving into the http payload of the packets.  We didn&#x27;t, but this kind of thing is most definitely possible, and I wouldn&#x27;t trust other shady entities not to do it."

"The vast majority of local municipalities have to balance their budget.  And their options for credit are vastly more constrained.

But if a city can do it, or have a local company do it and it doesn&#x27;t cost too much (they can waive fees for running cable, or whatever) then it may pay for itself, at least in part, because not only do they benefit from whatever they collect in fees, but broadband can increase local tax revenue (a house with 1000mb&#x2F;s internet is worth more then a house with 2mb internet)."

The RAID was fine for about a couple of month and seeing almost 3 GB&#x2F;s throughput was mindblowing. But suddenly we we saw drives randomly failing. But the drives did not completly fail, we were able to rebuild the RAID with the same hard drive. We did that a couple of times until we thought it was too much hassle and used the drives somewhere else. Now we are buying Crucial M4s and they are totally fine.

"Here is how to think about NUMA. In a modern AMD epyc box, you have 2 CPUs. Each cpu has 350GB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth and has PCI devices connected to it. Memory speed between CPU sockets is some fraction, 70GB&#x2F;s? 
if you run computation on cpu0 and talk to nic on cpu1, you burn a lot more cpu cycles, than if you move your computation to cpu1.
So in theory, if you partition the box using containers such that everything on cpu0 runs in container0 and has own nics, and same thing on cpu1. You end up with 2 &#x27;virtual&#x27; boxes that might actually perform better within your container than outside of it.<p>Note on modern CPUs, each cpu is further broken down into numa nodes(numactl -H and numa stuff n lscpu)...perf degradation isn&#x27;t as great going between chiplets, but it&#x27;s measurable(2x reduction in ram bandwidth?)."

"I disagree - the rampant complexity of systems you can build using all these extra services is the bigger problem, and at scale, all these extra services on AWS cost more than their OSS equivalent running on VMs.  Take a look at ELB for example, there&#x27;s a per-request charge that yes is very small, but at 10k req&#x2F;s it&#x27;s significant - not to mention the extra bytes processed charges.  Nginx&#x2F;haproxy with DNS load balancing can do pretty much what ELB is offering.  In the very small none of this matters, but you can just run smaller&#x2F;bigger VMs as needed; prices starting at the cost of a hamburger per month.<p>Re reliablity, I have VMs on AWS with multiple years of uptime - it&#x27;s the base building block of the entire system, so it&#x27;s expected to work all the time.  You monitor those systems with any sort of nagios-type tool and alert into something like pager duty for when things do go wrong, but they mostly don&#x27;t.  Redundancy I build in at the VM layer.<p>Additional services on AWS however have their own guarantees and SLAs and they&#x27;re more often down than the low-level virtual machines are - so it&#x27;s an inherently less reliable way to build systems imo, but to each their own.<p>Also, this notion that you can conveniently split your processing up into 15m chunks is just crazy -- you may never know how long some batch job is going to take any given day if it&#x27;s long running.  They&#x27;re typically leaning on some other systems outside your control that may have differing availability over time.  I met a guy who built some scraper on lambda that did something convoluted and he was happy to make like 100k updates in the db overnight -- I built a similar thing using a single core python job running on a VM that did 40MM updates in the same amount of time.  It&#x27;s just silly what people think simple systems are not capable of."

"&gt; I am a Comcast subscriber, and like many Comcast subscribers I&#x27;m sure, I have one of their boxes in my house, with the most basic Cable TV package, because if I don&#x27;t take it my cost goes up (I mean the overall price of the monthly billed amount from Comcast&#x2F;Xfinity)<p>This seems to vary region to region.

"I think you could accomplish this more easily with a semi-evacuated floating tunnel heading east from the Galapagos Islands, and up the west slope of Chimborazo, whose peak is the closest to space of any other mountain on Earth.<p>That means it already has higher angular velocity by virtue of being close to the equator, and is further from the Earth&#x27;s center of gravity by virtue of being situated on the equatorial bulge.

"The speed of sound in graphene is 22 km&#x2F;s. If your tether were made of monocrystalline  carbon fiber, it looks like you would have to boost the whole apparatus to 8+ km&#x2F;s first to catch a 30km&#x2F;s object, and you could then leave the solar system at something less than 52 km&#x2F;s.<p>For comparison, the New Horizon probe to Pluto and beyond left at 23 km&#x2F;s.<p>With a thousand km of graphene-fiber tether standing perpendicular to the object&#x27;s path, it would take 45s to accelerate the probe at a peak of 484 km&#x2F;s&#x2F;s. For a 10kg probe, that would put 4.8e9 N of tension on the tether.<p>Graphene has a tensile strength of 130000 MPa, or 1.3e11 N&#x2F;m^2, so the cable would need to be some 20cm thick.<p>Boosting to a higher speed would reduce the cable thickness needed proportionally. At 19 km&#x2F;s, quite doable, it&#x27;s 10 cm.
However, boosting 1000 km of 10cm cable to 19 km&#x2F;s would take quite a fair bit more fuel than just boosting the probe itself to the target speed of 41 km&#x2F;s."

"You need a rough complete rocket design to compare propulsion systems.<p>If your Mars mission has a 10 km&#x2F;s delta vee, and your exhaust velocity is 10 km&#x2F;s (ISP = 1000 s), then your velocity ratio is 1 and your fueled to empty mass ratio is e^1 = 2.7. Let&#x27;s round that to 3. Ie your rocket is 2 parts fuel and 1 part other stuff like engines and tank and payload.<p>If you need initial acceleration of say 1 km&#x2F;s per day, then in SI units your acceleration is 0.01 m&#x2F;s^2. If you have a nuclear thermal engine with a thrust to weight of 3, that means 30 m&#x2F;s^2 or 30 N per kg.<p>For a 100 ton empty mass, you need a 300 ton initial fueled rocket. To accelerate, you need 300000 x 0.01 = 3000 newtons of thrust, meaning only a paltry 100 kg of nuclear rocket engine!<p>If your tanks have a mass ratio of 10 (hydrogen means this might not be trivial), you have 20 t of tanks. That leaves 100-20=80 t for payload. (The engine is in the noise.) This would be excellent.<p>With a chemical rocket, your specific impulse would be a lot worse, your propellant mass would be a lot more (3-4x), but the tanks would contain mostly liquid oxygen by weight and thus could be lighter per contained propellant mass so it might not be as bad. Engine thrust to weight might be 10x so total engine mass could still be lower, but it doesn&#x27;t dominate in this kind of slow acceleration mission.<p>With a nuclear or solar electric rocket, you might have some weird propellant - availability and tank mass depends on that. The engine is going to be really heavy.<p>To me, a nuclear thermal makes sense for Mars missions - it is a good fit for the problem. You still need the chemical rockets for takeoff and landing at each end. Also if you assemble in LEO, there&#x27;s the question of passage through the radiation belts if you accelerate really slowly.<p>It might work for lunar work as well, haven&#x27;t looked at it."

The really interesting part is that the elevator would not be in a true geostationary orbit traveling at ~3000m&#x2F;s. instead it would be traveling at 100m&#x2F;s at the same height.<p>The delta-V to reach GEO without the radial velocity to maintain it is closer to 10 km&#x2F;s if you use the partial escape velocity equation. This is pretty huge as mass required to achieve delta-V is nonlinear.

"They seem to just trying to milk as much out of their DSL customers as possible, designed to push them to fiber.  I used to have their DSL.  Their DSL price was then raised to $55+ a month after the $40 introductory rate.  The speed was not great at 3Mb&#x2F;s, due to AT&amp;T line quality.  I&#x27;ve asked for a break due to the low speed but the response was the $40 was for new customers.  It&#x27;s a horrible deal even for $40.  I finally bit the bullet and switched to Comcast on 100Mb&#x2F;s for $50."
"Not sure wounding vs. killing was the big differentiator. As tptacek mentions, any non-trivial rifle-calibre hit is incapacitating. What determines whether the victim dies immediately or has a chance to survive depends on where it hits.<p>The big things, as you mention, was that real life engagement ranges were considerably shorter, so you could sacrifice long-range performance and gain lighter weight (allowing the soldier to carry more rounds) and making the thing somewhat controllable on full auto for close-quarter fighting.<p>The Germans figured this out, and towards the end of WWII they fielded the &quot;Sturmgewehr 44 (Stg 44)&quot;. This fired a shortened version of their standard rifle calibre round (7.92mm). The Soviets did the same with their Ak-47 family. The price of keeping the full rifle caliber but slow round (around 700 m&#x2F;s muzzle velocity) was poor ballistics and armor penetration.<p>Later on the US went to the other extreme with a very small caliber firing at higher than usual rifle muzzle velocity (almost 1000 m&#x2F;s).<p>Ironically there was research going back all the way to pre-WWII times suggesting the &quot;optimal&quot; infantry caliber would be somewhere in the 6-7mm range with muzzle velocity in the &quot;standard&quot; range for rifles (around 800-900 m&#x2F;s)."

"The newest machine has an I7 6700k.<p>Every machine has a raid 1 of &quot;high performance&quot; SSDs. Most have Corsair force3 GTs. The 4th gen is an untrabook with room for only one SATA3 ssd, so I put a Mushkin M3 drive in in for the raid. The Newest machine some other SSD that is just slightly faster. The read speeds are something like this 1st gen -&gt; 1.2GB&#x2F;s, 2nd gen -&gt; 1.2GB&#x2F;s, 4th gen -&gt; 1.1GB&#x2F;s (the M3 drive slows it slightly), 6th gen -&gt; 1.3GB&#x2F;s.<p>Each machine is faster than the previous by a wide margin, far more than the proportional speed difference from the slowest to the fastest. There is almost a whole minute between (3m to 2m) from the 4th to 6th.<p>The first gen has 2 cores with hyperthreading (looks like 4 in gnome system monitor), the quad cores with hyperthreading where far out of my price range.  All the rest, the 2nd, 4th and 6th gen have 4 cores and hyperthreading (looks like 8 in gnome system monitor).<p>For reference each of these was around $1,600 plus or minus $200, except the 6th gen. The 6th also has an nVidia 980 (not the normal mobile version) and 4 total hard drives.

"A synapse is responsible both for storing its weight, and for operating on its weight. Therefore, model size and throughput are interrelated numbers. If a synapse in a bee brain fires at 10 Hz on average (my guess), total events per second is 10 times the brain ‘capacity’. Max firing rate will be a lot larger, since most neurons are silent most of the time.<p>In silicon we separate out the storage from the compute. Generally we have much more storage than we have compute, and we route the data to the compute units as we need computation. Therefore ALUs have aggregate throughput of only a small fraction of the model capacity per cycle; at 400,000 cores with, say, 8 16-bit operations per cycle each, that is ‘only’ ~10^6 operations per cycle.<p>A better way to get a measure of computational throughput is to compare those values. Numbers are hard to find, but 10^10 synaptic events&#x2F;s for a bee and 10^15 edge calculations&#x2F;s for Cerebras seems the right sort of ballpark. That&#x27;s a difference of 10^5, a little less than your estimate of 10^7."
"A free Fiber is not viable on the long run. It looks like dumping to me. It looked more like an attempt to kill competitors than a constructive competitive pressure.<p>However I find 50$ expensive. The most expensive offer in France is Orange for 37€ (42USD) for 100Mbit&#x2F;s download and 50Mbit&#x2F;s upload. And with this you get 160 TV channels and unlimited phone calls through the fiber.<p>I have 1000MBit&#x2F;s download and 250 Mbit&#x2F;s upload for 26€ (~30USD), many tv channels and unlimited phone calls and fixed IP address (no IPv6 support yet). This allows to use twitch and publish our games. It also allows to do a backup and restore of my rented server in a snap although I could in theory host it at home.<p>I&#x27;m afraid that US people loose the benefit of much cheaper device prices (Apple, etc) on the cost of monthly fee of the Internet line or mobile phone line."
"That&#x27;s still terrible performance, your average MacBook Pro these days will provide between 100,000 and 300,000 IOP&#x2F;s on 4k random reads and the average VM we deploy from our storage servers (commodity SSD based linux clusters that are cheap and ultra reliable) provide between 70,000-200,000 random 4k read (and write) IOPs per VM without a sweat and their TCO is significantly lower than amazons SSD storage that&#x27;s 3 ½ - 10x slower per volume.<p>Even if you go and provision storage on Vultr, Ramnode or Sitehost all of which are a lot cheaper options and just as if not more reliable provide considerably faster storage with a minimum of 20&#x2F;30,000 IOPs up to 150,000 IOPs per volume and you don&#x27;t have the vendor lock-in or the hidden costs such as inter-zone data transfer etc...<p>Amazon really needs to pull finger on their storage performance, but it&#x27;s not in their best interest. What they want you to do is scale horizontally which means not only do you need to invest in your system &#x2F; product design to do this but you also have to put more money into Amazons pockets for additional compute &#x2F; storage nodes and again the associated hidden costs.<p>I&#x27;m not digging on Amazon &#x2F; outsourced hosting providers but they truly are pulling the wool over people&#x27;s eyes while still trying to make everyone think that they&#x27;re not only the best option they&#x27;re the <i>only</i> option."

"When I do OS updates (Fedora, so that&#x27;s dnf and rpm) with a system on USB flash or SD Card flash, the write are abysmal. Like, 3-4MB&#x2F;s, using `iotop -d3 -o`. There&#x27;s almost no reads suggesting the RPMs that have been downloaded are cached. I experience this with ext4, btrfs, and f2fs.<p>Using strace on both dnf and rpm, there&#x27;s no appreciable amount of sync(), fsync(), or fdatasync()  - so I&#x27;m not really sure why there was this persistent ~4MB&#x2F;s trickle to the card rather than large &quot;state&quot; updates, in particular for f2fs and Btrfs. All three make heavy use of delayed allocation, but in particular f2fs and Btrfs have no specifically designated locations for write, or overwrites. So I&#x27;d expect that most update OS type writes should&#x2F;could be much faster.<p>A sequential write is ~20MB&#x2F;s on both of these media, and sequential reads are ~150MB&#x2F;s.

"I’ve read that ICBMs are very hard to spot after the initial boost phase. That being the case, if I was an ICBM designer, I’d add a cold gas thruster to the payload stage that allowed the target to be adjusted or fine tuned while it was out of the atmosphere in a stealthy way — even a delta-V of just 100 m&#x2F;s adds up to 280km when the missile takes 45 minutes to arrive."
"Video compression is a calculus of IO capacity, memory, and algorithmic complexity. Take the MPEG-1 codec for instance, it was new about 30 years ago. While today most people think of MPEG-1 videos as low quality the spec provides the ability to handle bit rates up to 100Mb&#x2F;s and resolutions up to 4095x4095. That was <i>way</i> higher than the hardware of the time supported.<p>One of MPEG-1&#x27;s design goals was to get VHS-quality video at a bitrate that could stream over T1&#x2F;E1 lines or 1x CD-ROMs. The limit on bitrate led to increased algorithmic complexity. It was well into the Pentium&#x2F;PowerPC era until desktop systems could play back VCD quality MPEG-1 video in software.<p>Later MPEG codecs increased their algorithmic complexity to squeeze better quality video into low bit rates. A lot of those features existed on paper 20-30 years ago but weren&#x27;t practical on hardware of the time, even custom ASICs. Even within a spec features are bound to profiles so a file&#x2F;stream can be handled by less capable decoders&#x2F;hardware.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of video codecs  or settings for them that can choke modern hardware. It also depends on what you mean by &quot;modern hardware&quot;. There&#x27;s codecs&#x2F;configurations a Threadripper with 64GB of RAM in a mains powered jet engine sounding desktop could handle in software that would kill a Snapdragon with 6GB of RAM in a phone. There&#x27;s also codecs&#x2F;configurations the Snapdragon in the phone could play using hardware acceleration that would choke a low powered Celeron or Atom decoding in software."

They stopped at 256 when it was about to take over redis.<p>Now if you look at workload A and B, workload A supposed to have 50&#x2F;50 read&#x2F;write while workload B was 95&#x2F;5 read&#x2F;write. You see that memcached performed terribly there. You would think that perhaps the access pattern is different but then if you look at rest of databases they perform closely to workload A. And memcached which was doing 15000req&#x2F;s is doing 10000req&#x2F;s on a workload which supposed to be less work.<p>This looks to me that performance issue is most likely not in memcached itself but in their test application, but we can&#x27;t prove that because they did not release code they used for testing."

For a long time, your best option for your fibre line was 128kbit&#x2F;s analog-modem over digital-line.<p>Eastern Europe&#x27;s infrastructure may date from around the same time, which may make it easier to improve now. It&#x27;s a second-mover advantage. Compare NTSC vs. PAL, or (maybe, not completely sure) 230V vs 110V mains.<p>Also, in terms of &quot;Government regulation&quot; there really isn&#x27;t anything stopping Deutsche Telekom from improving its network.

"Easy divisibility is the reason why when we switched to metric, the one thing that didn&#x27;t switch is time.  Which means that, for example, converting from m&#x2F;s to km&#x2F;h is a mess.

These units would give us both easy divisibility and are close enough to existing time units to make sense.<p>This change would mean we have to memorize a 12 times table rather than a 10 times table.  But in base 10 a 10 times table has easy patterns for 1, 2, 5, 9 and 10.  A 12 times table has repeating patterns for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12.  The result is that a 12 times table in base 12 is actually less work to memorize than a 10 times table in base 10.<p>In the long run this transition would be a clear win.

"For a ballistic or hypersonic missile you need it anyway, to radiate away atmospheric heating.<p>The challenge with an ABM laser weapon system is generating enough power on-target that it&#x27;s not just a rounding error for the energy that needs to be dissipated anyway.  A quick back-of-the-envelope physics calculation indicates that&#x27;ll be hard.  An 80kg warhead is moving at about 5000 m&#x2F;s upon re-entry and has a kinetic energy of about 1 GJ.  I dunno what fraction of that kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy upon re-entry; for manned spacecraft it&#x27;s &quot;almost all of it&quot; because they need to go subsonic for parachutes to deploy, but for ballistic missiles, let&#x27;s guess 1&#x2F;1000th for ease of math, or 1 MJ.  Current laser weapons systems have a range of about 1mi (and the range of lasers is heavily limited by atmospheric considerations - atmospheric refraction will reduce your accuracy, while heating of water vapor, dust, and air can sap the energy).  That&#x27;s about 1&#x2F;3 of a second on target, so the power output needed is about 3 MW.  Current laser weapon systems like the AN&#x2F;SEQ-3 have a power output of about 30 kW.  This needs to scale up by a factor of 100 under conservative assumptions.<p>Like the article said, the solution to many of these issues is to put the lasers in space and intercept missiles in the boost phase.  Then they&#x27;re moving slower, you&#x27;re targeting volatile fuel &amp; oxidizer instead of heat shields, and you don&#x27;t have atmospheric losses to worry about.  You do have the issue of how to loft a giant laser, capacitor, and energy source into orbit, though, and how to protect them up there when a conflict starts."

By using more sophisticated &#x2F; denser encodings, we can scale the same 4G tech to even higher speeds. Think 1gbit&#x2F;s speeds for mid-market phones. This is effectively enabled due to the smaller node sizes also being more power efficient, which is required for mobile phones.<p>The advances are less in your face, but still there."

"Rather flawed argument, when you consider that it&#x27;s comparing general purpose servers to highly specialized asic&#x2F;fpga miners.  I have no doubt that if google really wanted to, they could roll out the same kind of specialized mining hardware and dominate the blockchain, they just have no reason to.  Consider, specialized hardware can get up to 1,000 MHash&#x2F;s&#x2F;$, which means an investment of $1000 would get you 1,000,000 MHash&#x2F;s.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at google&#x27;s datacenter expenditure.  They spent something like $11 billion of datacenter expenses in 2014, and even considering that part of that is non-server related expenses(real estate and building infrastructure), let&#x27;s see what happens when we punch $5 billion into hashing hardware.  I get a value of around 5,000 PetaHashes&#x2F;s, which would absolutely swamp the network, as it&#x27;s only sitting at 35PH&#x2F;s.  Also, consider that that&#x27;s just their expenditure for 1 year, not the total they&#x27;ve put into their datacenters.<p>In conclusion, comparing cpus capable of general purpose computation to specialized hardware that can only do one thing is useless.  After all, how many search querys per second can the blockchain handle?"

"This is a common misunderstanding, and was the point of the example. A stationary observer <i>observing</i> a particle being accelerated towards the speed of light would <i>observe</i> that particles apparent mass begin to approach infinity as its observed velocity approached the speed of light, thus requiring an amount of energy approaching infinity to continue to accelerate it further. However, this has nothing to do with the scenario with you being that particle.<p>You are currently moving at near the speed of light relative to many things at this very moment, yet your mass is certainly not approaching infinity, America notwithstanding! And if you accelerated enough in the opposite direction of your relative partner to exceed the speed of light it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;d suddenly start finding it impossible. No, it&#x27;s a matter of observation. From the other particle&#x27;s perspective it would see your mass approaching infinity and your speed would slow, but the distances you covered would remain the same due to length contraction.<p>A similar effect explains why, for instance, particles in CERN&#x27;s reactors travel distances that should be impossible for them to travel before decaying. E.g. if the speed of light was 10m&#x2F;s and a particle decays after 3 seconds then it should be impossible to see that particle travel more than 30 meters. Yet we see it travel hundreds of meters. Isn&#x27;t relativity fun?"
"I&#x27;d also like to notice that while the article says some good things it nonetheless falls itself into the trap of &quot;generational thinking&quot;, where it clearly says that life-hacking hustling is the problem of some ghostly &quot;millenials&quot;. Then suddenly equating &quot;millenials&quot; with &quot;young people&quot;, obviously forgetting that if you say A you cant escape saying B and if you argue along the lines of &quot;generational logic&quot; (and that&#x27;s failed logic) you can&#x27;t not mention &quot;Z&quot; people, who also work hard already these days. Aren&#x27;t they &quot;millenials&quot;? Why? Ah, I get ya, they have been growing with tech, while &quot;millenials&quot; only picked tech just before teens. So that makes &quot;Z&quot; totally different brand of people &#x2F;s. Not shared environment, not shared culture, but the year you were born is what defines you and defines whether you were growing &quot;with tech&quot;. And growing with tech makes you completely (or very) different &#x2F;s. Totally makes sense. I&#x27;ve read that some of the people going along the lines of this failed &quot;generational&quot; logic even go as far as stating that anyone born in 1998 is a millenial while anyone born in 1999 is already a Z.<p>In all serious, this &quot;generational&quot; bullshit stereotypizes people, similarly to how racism tries to solely define people in terms of their skin shade. That&#x27;s total bullshit, there are completely different people among people born in 1980-1998 and some were already growing with tech, some didn&#x27;t, some born in 1999 haven&#x27;t seen tech to this day, some did, some&#x27;ve grown with it. Some of those born in 1960-1980 grew with tech too, they also are very prey-fallible to these types of &quot;motivational&quot; videos. And it&#x27;s plain ridiculous to call someone a &quot;young, cause millenial&quot; cause they were born in 1980 but a 1979-borns are &quot;not young, cause boomers&quot;. &quot;Generational racism&quot; (I&#x27;d go as far as to define it like that) just doesn&#x27;t add anything to any conversation, enforces stereotypes and need to be fought against.<p>I encourage you to fight against it too. Generational racism wont do any good to people. Thanks!"

"I had to create this account just to correct this.  &quot;Broadband&quot; means the data is modulated on to a wide spectrum signal, on the same copper as the POTS network.

"If you&#x27;re a net neutrality advocate you should seriously consider whether this sort of peering arrangement should be tolerated. This kind of peering is a de-facto QoS arrangement that gives Netflix a performance and cost advantage over other video providers that aren&#x27;t big enough or rich enough to justify and pay for direct peering with ISPs. It also gives bigger ISPs (that do more than 2Gb&#x2F;s of traffic to Netflix and agree to peer, apparently) the same advantage over their smaller competitors. Isn&#x27;t that exactly what we&#x27;re trying to avoid with net neutrality?<p>This is not a new practice and I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t come up more frequently in the net neutrality debate. It&#x27;s been going on for years -- broadcast.com did it, YouTube and Google do it, and I&#x27;m sure others do as well.

Since the distance a signal can travel before it loses too much energy to register logic HIGH is proportional to the wavelength, you have to pack everything close enough while still doing what your specs call for.

"Let&#x27;s see. The sabre engine has a closed cycle specific impulse of 450, which gives an effective exhaust velocity of 4.4 km&#x2F;s. LEO requires about 7.8 km&#x2F;s velocity while mach 5 is 1.7 km&#x2F;s. In one case you accelerate from 0 to 7.8 km&#x2F;s an in the other from 1.7 to 7.8 (for 6.1 km&#x2F;s delta-v). The first figure gives a mass ratio of 5.9 while the second one gives you ratio of 4.0. You save about 1&#x2F;3 of the initial mass if you only have to burn on a closed cycle from Mach 5 upwards.<p>In reality gravity is a tough mistress so actual rockets launching from a pad require about 9.0 km&#x2F;s delta-v because they lose a substantial amount due to the gravity losses of climbing up from Earth&#x27;s gravity well. This is especially true for the first few km&#x27;s of altitude where the thrust-to-mass ratio is quite low. Potentially, the skylon will eliminate most of those gravity losses by effectively launching from 26km altutude at mach 5 (i&#x27;m ignoring the relatively modest fuel consumption for reaching this state - the specific impulse is about 3500).<p>Assuming a delta-v of 9.0 km&#x2F;s needed for a single stage rocket gives a mass ratio of 7.7. This means that the skylon should save about 48% of the initial mass required by a SSTO rocket launching from sea level."

"I would argue that that number is a bit high for sense input. Figures I&#x27;ve seen are about 20x lower on the high end. The only time I&#x27;ve seen estimates as high as the one you gave are when they are considering the full field of vision for each eye and translating that directly to pixels assuming there is 100% fidelity. Human vision doesn&#x27;t work that way, we dedicate far fewer neurons to our peripheral vision outside the fovea. You also have to remember that neurons transmit data at a much slower rate than electrical connections (100m&#x2F;s vs 300,000km&#x2F;s) so the path to building a better brain machine interfce is to have a large number of electrodes which seems to me a fairly straightforward problem to solve e.g. make them smaller and adding more of them. The other side of the coin is that we aren&#x27;t aware of all of our sensory input all of the time so you can get away with only transmitting the important stuff which greatly reduces the bandwidth needed. Further out, there&#x27;s likely some form of abstraction going on inside our brains and if we can communicate data on that level we&#x27;ll likely need even less input to create a realistic experience.<p>As an aside, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d opt for the type of uploading outlined in that novel considering it involves a posthumous destructive scan of the connectome. There wouldn&#x27;t be any continuity so you&#x27;d probably just end up with a copy.

"With SQL Server I don&#x27;t get 2000MB&#x2F;s on the same hardware, more like 600-800MB&#x2F;s. This is most likely because of LZ4 compression and large block sizes(64k-128k) on ZFS, that results in a lot less IO. Because with SQL Server, IO was the bottleneck.<p>So yes, it is very workload specific. For random read&#x2F;write they are probably more similar. But for reading a lot of data that can be read sequentially, PostgreSQL seems to win hands down, because it can get a lot of help from ZFS compression.<p>I would love to run the same test when SQL Server is available on Linux. But ZFS do also deliver slightly better throughput and slightly more iops on the FreeBSD platform, which I ran this benchmark on. And SQL Server probably demands a 4k block size, which is so small that LZ4 compression has no effect as I&#x27;ve already tried to run SQL Server on ZFS via iSCSI."

The problem you should worry about is a firmware bug in the part of the drive that handles the wear leveling abstraction.

Inertial sensors are pretty amazing nowadays, but they still drift.<p>To illustrate, if your wheels aren&#x27;t moving, then you can ignore the IMU telling you that you&#x27;re sinking into the ground at 5mm&#x2F;s.

For instance, we get hopping, trotting, strafing, turning + strafing, walking. What it can&#x27;t do is prancing or a flying trot. But we think it&#x27;s totally worth it since a good-enough servo is around $20, while similarly sized torque-controllable servo (excluding dynamixels, which don&#x27;t actually have torque control), runs about $400 each. DJI did actually come out recently with their M3508 and M2006 which we&#x27;re starting to play with, and we think we can build a torque-controllable pupper for about $1.5k.<p>The main limitation I think for servo robots with kinematic (position-control) controllers is speed.

In 1966 the Luna 9 lander used retrorocket thrusters to arrest its descent to the lunar surface to 6 m&#x2F;s at 5 meters above the lunar surface (airbags handled the rest.)   This is not quite as impressive as what SpaceX does today for a few reasons, but it seems to me that a concerted effort to iterate on this tech could have been a lot more successful decades ago than you think.<p>(I believe in 1970 Luna 17 landed on the moon with no airbags, but I don&#x27;t know much about Luna 17)"

"Back when communication was still phoneline-connection oriented this was done all the time. You had a contractual quality target of 0.0n% of calls that either aborted or did not connect at all over the yearly average. You then over-provisioned your phone system to hit that target. That could mean adding two additional lines you never need just so new year&#x27;s eve does not screw you over.<p>There are mathematical models that describe the probability of a new call coming in at any given time. Add the system in terms of how many connections it can have active and how many it can queue, and you can calculate your required sizing for a given quality level.<p>As a sidenode, this is also why ISDN flatrates were doomed, because the always-connected nature of them broke the models the system was based on. And why new phone companies renting capacity from established ones could offer cheaper connections, they simply rented at a much higher allowed connection error rate.<p>Using similar, well, maybe even much easier math, you can calculate that your current system at your desired maximum utilization level allows for 432KiB&#x2F;s downstream for every customer, but if the overall network is underutilized you can achieve up to the n MiB&#x2F;s your connection is rated for.<p>Then you add for example hierarchical traffic shaping where queues are allowed to borrow unused bandwidth from other queues. But it is a huge investment, no doubt.<p>Also, guaranteed bandwidth is imho not that different from a service level target in Bit. You&#x27;ll have to refund if you break the SLA, the same as if you break your promise."

"<i>Seems highly unlikely these crazy &#x27;from outside the solar system&#x27; ideas are likely.</i><p><i>This meme spreads well, but that to me means there is far more chance it is not true. The fact no one questions it also seems suspicious.</i><p>This left about 24 km&#x2F;s faster than anything can go and remain inside of the Solar System.  Do you have any idea how much energy it takes to get something going that fast?<p>A baseball going that fast has about 42 megajoules of kinetic energy.  A semi on the interstate has about half a megajoule of kinetic energy.  This thing was at least 100 meters long and all of it was going that fast.<p>For the record we do not have the technology to fire a rocket that fast.  We only managed to get rockets to leave the Solar System by loading them up with gravity assists from planets.  And even so they didn&#x27;t get to that speed.  If two asteroids have a head on collision, the pieces won&#x27;t move that fast.  (And it would have to be a heck of a collision to make a piece that big.)<p>If this came from inside of the Solar System, WTF accelerated it, how did it do so without breaking the object into smithereens, and why didn&#x27;t we see evidence of the event that caused it?<p>By contrast this was going just about the average speed of interstellar objects in our neighborhood.  (The Sun happens to be just passing through the ecliptic, and spends most of its time well above or below the Milky Way. Therefore to us, everything in our neighborhood is moving fast.) Any junk hanging around would have a trajectory that looks like this one.  Now obviously space is pretty empty.  Which is why it is so impressive that we actually spotted something from space.<p>Yes.  It is highly unlikely that anything we see in the Solar System didn&#x27;t come from here.  But it is effectively impossible for anything starting in the outer reaches of the Solar System to get to this speed.  And extremely likely that an interstellar object would go about this fast.  Therefore it probably is an interstellar object."

"They are bad but not way off for that basic for loop, depending on which rotation is being applied.<p>Using their code on my Intel-based workstation at around 3ghz using GCC 7.3 it takes around 80-100ms to rotate a 4096x4096 buffer 90 or 270, and 14ms to rotate 180.<p>Max memory bandwidth of something like an i9-9900k is 41.2GB&#x2F;s. This test reads &amp; writes 128mib of data. So max theoretical achievable performance here is around 3-4ms. Max theoretical. So 100x is not really feasible. 10x, though, very much is, as the quick convert shows a peak time of 14ms with a 180* rotation.<p>Of course the major source of slowness here is that the reads&#x2F;writes are not sequential, and the 90 &amp; 270 rotations are achieving a fraction of the possible bandwidth they could as the input reads are jumping around, so every single one is a cache miss and the other 60 bytes in each cache line on the miss will be purged before it&#x27;s used again.<p>Flipping it would mean the writes are never utilizing a full cache line, either, though. So you can&#x27;t really &quot;fix&quot; that, not easily at least. So either your read or write bandwidth ends up tanking and you can only achieve roughly 6% of the max (only ever using 4 bytes of the 64-byte cache line) for that half of the problem. Without some clever magic to handle this your max theoretical on a 41.2GB&#x2F;s CPU drops to around 50ms.<p>All that said it&#x27;s clear that WASM is very far off from native levels of performance. ~5x slower isn&#x27;t something to brag about.

Or, maybe more pertinently, people lived just fine (oftentimes better) without a good chunk of &quot;disruption&quot; and &quot;innovation&quot; that comes out of SF&#x2F;SV.

"1) we will release on premise version to address that (yes, you can deploy more machines to do HA and load balancing)<p>2) AWS allows us to get new IP addresses quickly and APIs will ban rather the auth key than the IP address no? There are huge networks behind NAT like mobile and companies so providers has to count with that.<p>3) We enforce single point of entry to the Traffic Monitor through the generated unique URL and key we generated for you. The monitors are jailed on several levels, so they can&#x27;t access outside resources.<p>4) We are having optional SSL now but enforcing it in next days.<p>5) We don&#x27;t want to enforce any limits other than abusing the service.

"Sure, but it&#x27;s not clear to me that the best way to deal with the two memory classes would be with NUMA-aware scheduling, unless you happen to have an application with &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; application threads (which I suspect describes relatively few applications in practice; and even if it does, wouldn&#x27;t you have to tell the scheduler about it explicitly?)  Seems to me like it will usually be much more efficient to use the MCDRAM either as L3 (default configuration) or as an explicit scratchpad (which a scheduler wouldn&#x27;t really be able to exploit, given that if the scheduler has data structures that don&#x27;t fit in L2 it&#x27;s already probably screwed).<p>That being said, I did some more reading this morning and the sub-NUMA clustering configuration on the new Phi does provide tile-to-directory-to-MCDRAM affinity (via pin domains), which would make sense for maximizing its performance as either L3 or scratchpad; AFAICT this is not the case for the remote DDR4, though.  So whether it&#x27;s worth caring probably depends very much on your workload; I think KNL is most interesting for workloads with working datasets that are much larger than 16GB, since otherwise you could just use a GPU (you can get more usable working memory per second with much better bandwidth with something like a DGX-1 thanks to NVLink, but unless I&#x27;m missing something not at a remotely competitive pricepoint, and it&#x27;s unclear to me whether it&#x27;s sustainable for larger working sets since you can only transfer up to 80 GB&#x2F;s from the CPU to the GPUs, which is lower than the 90 GB&#x2F;s each Phi gets out of DDR4 on Triad [and a better comparison is probably the 115.2 theoretical peak for KNL anyway])."
"Sounds like my story too (lost 25kg about 7yrs ago and kept it off). I generally rotate on a 1-week cycle. The only daily rules I follow are (1) never eat noodles more than once a day, and (2) eat some green vegetable&#x2F;s once a day. I also never keep food in my apartment to easily avoid snacking, so some days when the weather&#x27;s bad I&#x27;ll only eat twice. When I go to an eatery (restaurant or canteen stall), I usually have the same meal every time, but there&#x27;s about 10 different places I eat at, so I&#x27;m making the choice of what to eat when I choose which eatery to go to."

"I can&#x27;t imagine being able to establish multiple spatially separated beams between satellites that are hundreds or thousands of miles apart. If the beam were small enough to not &#x27;paint&#x27; the entire receiving satellite, it would be ridiculously sensitive to alignment. Even the tiniest movement would break the link.<p>Realistically, using optics, I can only see one spatial path to another satellite. You can use various wavelengths of light to establish multiple carriers, and probably get upwards of 1-2 Tb&#x2F;s of speed. But nothing near what is possible in the same space with fiber optics.<p>A 288 strand optical fiber cable, with jacket and armor is about 2cm in diameter. And each one of those 288 strands can carry terabits per second of data. It will be a very long time before free-space optics can match that kind of density."

We&#x27;re going to measure the position to one wavelength of visible light (say, 500 nm wavelength, so 5e-7 m).  That means that we need to be able to measure the momentum to an accuracy of 1e-28 kg m&#x2F;s, which for a mass of 1 kg means measuring the velocity to within an accuracy of 1e-28 m&#x2F;s.  Good luck with that..."

"Mostly talking about previous experience and especially any projects they were persoanally interested in talking about.<p>I find there is only one thing you need to ensure a new hire can handle to avoid the major fakers. Give them a simple problem that requires a for loop. Usually it takes up like 5 minutes of the interview. I started asking it when I realized that the weakest people on my team would get stuck talking about problems that were simple iterations, they&#x27;d spend days trying to avoid a simple &#x27;for foo in bar&#x27; coding solution. These were people who could program is the weirdest thing too. Fizzbuzz has become sort of a joke meme over the years but I&#x27;ve found Steve Yegge&#x27;s core idea to be true, and you can see the deer in headlights with even the simplest code problem. So now it&#x27;s all I do. Whiteboard coding is unnatural enough as it is, there&#x27;s no reason to haze when all you care about is will they get hung up on stupid trivial things. Most code is basic CRUD there is no reason to ask about b-trees or tris, let alone implement them.<p>If I feel the need to raise the bar even higher, I may include a simple pointer based question, since I&#x27;ve come to notice that indirection another concept that weaker coworkers struggle with. But the problem here, is that pointers just aren&#x27;t relevant to the majority of what devs do these days, and modern languages do well to hide their usage which means fewer candidates will even have worked in a language like C. So you&#x27;re likely to get a lot more false negatives. And interviews are stupidly expensive so you really want to avoid false negatives.<p>For reference I work for a company with less than 1000 employees, serving web traffic that needs to handle 2000req&#x2F;s peak 1000req&#x2F;s sustained.

"A low cost HPC number cruncher implies you seek the highest performance at its lowest price.
The energy used over its lifetime will be the main factor.
The capital cost of the processor will probably be less important than the price for the bulk memory.<p>First you should identify the price performance per watt of the systems (processor+memory+network) over their lifetime in your use case. This turns out to be very difficult. The few benchmarks you find online can not be easily compared. The interesting choices are usually just released and have no benchmarks yet. 
More problematic, benchmarks seldom list the energy and cost of a system<p>every year I try to design the lowest price&#x2F;performance&#x2F;watt system I can find, I spend a few weeks on this. Even with that much effort I have not been able to establish if a cluster of raspberry pi&#x27;s is faster and cheaper than an AMD EPYC with several cpu&#x27;s. Establishing the cost is even harder, if you want to manufacture enough of the systems to benefit from scale. (not a problem in a homebrew system)<p>Currently I guestimate that the best price&#x2F;performance&#x2F;watt system is some mass produced $1-$3 ARM (soon RISC-V) with two DRAM chips and a fast network connection like an FPGA with high speed SERDES link fabric switch.
Price per core plus memory must be way below $10. 
Raspberry pi&#x27;s are no contenders, they only have 200-300 Mbps network for 4 cores to share, that should be several gigabits&#x2F;s to be competitive.<p>A custom build AMD EPYC with several GPU&#x27;s networked together can turn out to be faster and cheaper. The retail price needs to be lowered and you need to build a similiar network fabric switch.<p>You can find better performance if you tailor the processor design to the task. So a system with the best price&#x2F;performance&#x2F;watt will be different for different software.<p>Even cheaper will be systems where you can rebalance part of the compute recources between different programs. The system will can less efficient because the hardware reconfigurability has has a high overhead, but that is offset by being more efficient for one program. You could for example balance transistors between integer, floating point, cache or network-on-chip (NoC).<p>We are currently making prototypes of our own design of a reconfgurable manycore processor with NoC fabric. Around $9 per core in an FPGA. The entry system costs around $80 and $500.<p>We plan to build this as an ASIC, the price will then drop to $1 per core including DRAM.<p>Even cheaper will be if we not slice the wafer into 22000 chips but leave it whole. You get over 100.000 cores with little memory with petabits&#x2F;s network for less than $6000. Half the wafer is reconfigurable logic that can be reprogrammed at runtime as GPU, TPU, CPU or any other custom optimisation. The energy cost of the wafer can be zero if you use the wafer as a water heating element and lower if you only run it on solar PV during the day. (If you share two wafers with a user on the night time side of the earth, you both can have 24 hour computing on $0,02 per kWh of solar PV). 
We can make a 180nm $500 version and a $1 version but they would not be as good as the 28nm $6000 version. A future 7nm wafer scale version might never be cheaper than the 28nm version, we will have to wait and see.<p>An silicon optical network on the wafer (also $6000) would allow two or more wafers to be networked at several terabits&#x2F;s. This overcomes its small memory problem.<p>Think of it, you want to get rid of any overhead in the system, like pcb, chip package, connectors, cables. You want to put everything on a single large chip, the whole wafer. Because we have different CMOS technology for DRAM or processors, we wind up with needing one wafer.<p>We are confident in 30 years we can grow the wafer(or 3D block) and the solar panel from CO2."

"&gt; While I get it that we can&#x27;t always be persnicketty about the definition of (thermodynamic) temperature I find these alternate, phenomenological temperatures often do more harm than good. It&#x27;s not just that it results in misleadingly juicy press releases.<p>My understanding is that there&#x27;s a historical reason for this convention. Many telescope observations are calibrated by comparing the sky measurements against measurements of thermal loads with known temperatures. Since the calibration sources are specified with a temperature, it&#x27;s straightforward to measure the source brightness in units of a pseudo-temperature. But I agree that it&#x27;s not intuitive for those familiar with it.<p>Another layer on this is fact that doppler broadening of emission lines from molecules means they cover a finite width. Since typical velocities in astronomy range from fractions of a km&#x2F;s to hundreds of kilometers per second, line widths are typically given in km&#x2F;s. Since these line widths originate due to doppler motions, a width in km&#x2F;s is equivalent to a width in Hz (for a given reference frequency for the spectral line).<p>The combination of these two things means people often report integrated flux measurements in units of K * km &#x2F; s! It seems bizarre at first, but this is equivalent to specifying it as power &#x2F; unit area (again, when there&#x27;s a reference frequency specified). But these units are often convenient in their own way."

How did you manage this?<p>On the stress side, the way I manage is that I see bootstrapping v&#x2F;s raising funding as a tradeoff between slow growth, higher chance of controlling your destiny v&#x2F;s fast growth, higher chance of fizzling and higher chance of giving up control. Since it&#x27;s chances and not certainties, what might seem successful competitors today might just be a matter of time. And what might seem struggle today could be totally worthwhile tomorrow.

"Not sure if your comment is sarcastic, but I&#x27;ll humor it.<p>Jupiter is orbiting the sun at 13 km&#x2F;s (very fast). If you slingshot around it, you can definitely be moving away from it at a decent clip. However, you&#x27;ll still be going around the sun at a pace near 13 km&#x2F;s (very fast). You still have to lose all of that orbital velocity before you can even think about going in the other direction. And even if you reduce your orbital velocity to zero, now you&#x27;re just going to fall into the sun. You need to add the bulk of what you just lost back into your orbital energy, but going the other direction. All of this has to be precicely manuvered to put you in an orbit to meet up with the probe. On top of all of that, you still have to climb out of Earth&#x27;s gravity well and spend a lot of fuel getting to Jupiter.<p>Also, once you start going the other direction, gravity assists become much more difficult to do with anything spinning normally. Inversely, if you don&#x27;t turn around, you&#x27;ll just wiz by the object when you meet up with it and have hardly any time for science."

"I am a long time contractor on oDesk and owe a great deal to this site.I wanted to talk a little about the hate the hourly model with screenshots is getting. Here&#x27;s the primary reason the video thing won&#x27;t work. Most of the providers are from third world countries where internet while decent is rarely good enough to support uploads in such massive volume. I have a 4 Mbps DSL connection and while i get great downstream, the upstream maxes out at 20 KB&#x2F;s. So yeah, that&#x27;s out of the window. However, screenshots work extremely effectively. I have close to 5000 hours logged on oDesk and barring a one off incident where i forgot to shut the logging software down and ended up logging extra hours( I refunded the client) i have never had a buyer dispute my hours. Here&#x27;s the thing, as an employer you have to be smart about it. When you post a job, only interview candidates with a good oDesk history,look at their past jobs, the buyer&#x27;s feedback, their portfolio etc. Then talk to them over Skype, ask for code samples etc. If you reach out for the bottom of the pool ofcourse you will get burned, but a contractor with a good history (who might be charging higher)will never ever endanger his feedback history in such a cut throat marketplace where even a single 4.99 out of 5 can knock you off the first page of search results and costing you big time, all for a few extra bucks. This alone will weed out 99% of the dishonest providers. But you can still go and initially, for a week or so, monitor the contractor&#x27;s work logs closely, you will know instantly if they are padding their hours since oDesk uploads around 5 to 6 screenshots per hour, along with mouse and keyboard activity reports. Just monitor them closely initially and then semi regularly afterwards and you will know what type of contractor you are dealing with. Once you have built trust and seen the contractor&#x27;s work you can ease up. Finally,set tight milestones and demand regular daily updates and you will know what&#x27;s going on.
So yeah, don&#x27; be lazy, be a little more vigilant and you can find some really good contractors at great prices .All the top contractors i know only work hourly and IMHO Its a great model for the employer and for the contractor, a simple win win."

"In concurrent&#x2F;parallel scenarios the memory bandwidth is often the bottleneck. So 1TB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth over 96 threads is about 10.5GB&#x2F;s each.  Not great, but the 3990x has what, 100GB&#x2F;s over 64 threads for about 1.5GB&#x2F;s each?"
"The ability to get 10 GB&#x2F;s dummy date into a pipe from the command line could come in handy at some point, for stress testing or something. I am not sure if it is over-optimized. (And even with the optimizations the risk of bugs should be very small.)"
"I&#x27;m sure such ageism exists, but you also need to consider the nature of software development. Just over the past decade, we transitioned from one model of deploying software to a totally different one, evolved into a somewhat widely accepted orchestration platform etc. The nature of software developments seems to required that one be capable of learning new technology and be comfortable with understanding new frameworks and such.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered engineers older than me who are just as excited by new technology as I am and are willing to learn about it and offer their perspective and wisdom as to how its different from what they were used to before, conversations which I find fascinating.<p>There are also those who I will call less-enthusiastic about the changes; and quickly get overwhelmed by change and either move into management positions or into roles or companies with less change.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is anything fundamentally better about one kind of engineer v&#x2F;s the other. The problem is only when you place an engineer who enjoys the change in a role that doesn&#x27;t involve much of it, or vice versa."

"It&#x27;s impossible to explain the Segwit2x bugs ignoring the social aspect.<p>The planned fork was supported by only part of the community, which would not have been a problem if it weren&#x27;t for the lack of replay protection, which would have lost many people money had the fork been activated. The rationale for not having replay protection was to take over the Bitcoin network as a whole, with the lack of differentiation from the &#x27;legacy&#x27; Bitcoin network being seen as a feature. In other words, rich people with a lot of mining power were planning on forcing the network into accepting their own rules (with most people in the network, running SPV wallets, doing so unknowingly), and if people lose money in the process, well, that&#x27;s just too bad.<p>And that&#x27;s just what touched me the most personally. There were a lot of other things in the Segwit2x process to be appalled with, such as the anti-developer culture, the infamous NYA closed meeting and general lack of transparency, and more.<p>Because I was disgusted with that bully approach, I did not invest any serious time reviewing the Segwit2x code changes, but instead did spend time studying, reviewing and contributing (my very small bit) to the Bitcoin Core code. I guess that other developers similarly had no drive to contribute to the Segwit2x codebase. I also think it&#x27;s probable some people have found the bug&#x2F;s and did not report them so as not to help bullies get their way.<p>In conclusion, the lack of review and testing, leading to the bugs, is not just a technical issue. Doing serious review and testing of open source code relies on support from the community, which was minimal, because very few competent developers in the space who understood what was going on wanted to help."
"I&#x27;m sure the idea has been considered - and then ignored as completely ridiculous when you do the math.<p>The biggest rocket ever built (the Saturn V) could take 140,000kg to low earth orbit. That&#x27;s nowhere near big enough to have any kind of significant gravitational attraction to &quot;mop&quot; objects away from their orbits. Some kind of magnet would be more feasible, but still not practical because operating a huge magnet in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field would affect the spacecraft itself.<p>Finally, once you would have &quot;mopped&quot; these objects into neat bunches, it would take 4 km&#x2F;s additional velocity to escape the earth and a whopping 30 km&#x2F;s to send things towards the sun (without any gravitational slingshot). Now you can calculate the amount of propellant (using the Rocket Equation) that it would take to send any meaningful payload that distance."

But as that water vapor shoots away from it, Newtons Third Law comes into play and the comet, ever so slightly, is pushed in the opposite direction.<p>You may rightfully say that this would be a very minuscule push, so what good will it do? Well, if you play Kerbal Space Program you&#x27;ll quickly learn that tiny nudges can have huge effects in the long-run, especially on big orbits. Add a few mm&#x2F;s to the velocity of a comet two years ahead of time, and it can make the difference between that comet hitting a planet, or not.

"DRAM type memory uses a completely different process than flash even if they&#x27;re both a form of &quot;memory&quot;.

DDR4 memory is typically 30-60GB&#x2F;s per bank with the low end being two-channel, the high end being four.<p>DRAM has also been the subject of aggressive research and development for many, many decades while large-scale production of flash is a relatively recent phenomenon. It&#x27;s the widespread adoption of smart phones, thinner notebooks, and ubiquitous USB keychain type devices that as pushed it to the volumes it&#x27;s at now.<p>There&#x27;s also the concern that DDR memory must have a very high level of data integrity, bit-flip errors are severely problematic, and it can&#x27;t wear out even after trillions of cycles. Flash has more pervasive error correction, and while wear is a minor concern, it&#x27;s still possible to exhaust it if you really, really try.<p>I&#x27;d say the reason flash memory prices are steeply down is the new &quot;3D&quot; process used by Intel and Samsung has been a big game-changer, allowing for much higher density.

"I re-read the paper in detail. There&#x27;s a lot more going on than the commentary on this page assumes, with some impressive calculations, but lots of unaccounted-for (and un-invented) elements, and even more unanswered questions.<p>For example, the author does assume 1gram (2ft diam) shields, but also specifies the necessity of precise angular orientation, and relatively modest location control &#x2F; steering.  This is to be accomplished by an unspecified number of &quot;control satellites&quot; using aimable mirrors and passive radiative pressure, which keeps the discs simple and the weight at 1 gram. Required disc area is ~7x the required total shading area, due to indecent angle and required transparency and spacing. A new gps-like network of &quot;navigation beacons&quot; will also be required to maintain spatial reference. He then says that to track individual disk locations&#x2F; orientation, that each disc needs a GPS-like nav receiver, 2 cameras, some processing&#x2F; communication ability, and a power supply, presumably solar. But he doesn&#x27;t account for (or even reconsider) that there will be added weight and cost due to this.<p>He also doesn&#x27;t consider the cost of inventing, manufacturing, and deploying the control satellites or the new type of nav beacon network, or even estimate how many of each will be needed. (GPS tech won&#x27;t work, but if he knows that, he doesn&#x27;t state it.)<p>There&#x27;s other questionable assumptions, like a launch cadence of every 5 minutes for 10 years to leo, and that cost of launch will roughly equal cost of fuel due to the scale.<p>He also estimates the method of transfer from leo to L1 will require delta-v of 1km&#x2F;s and assumes it will be solar powered &#x2F; ion propelled, but leaves it at that, also without scope or cost.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, but less convincing than I expected, given all the missing details, and also makes me more convinced that risk assessment, management and mitigation haven&#x27;t thoughtfully been considered. That said, the shading, geometric layout, and required material properties calculations are quite impressive."

In advertisement data is key, You say you used Facebook but what if your users are the people on twitter? You have venues, What is the most popular event&#x2F;s at these venues? Advertising can get expensive, advertising on the wrong channels can kill your startup.<p>Once you know who your users are you can use that data to market on platforms they use organically. Some times organic users come from partners or places. When I think Venue, I think weddings just like you tried on Facebook. Have you tried partnering with wedding retail stores, wedding planners, cake decorates etc? These are all people who connect with your potential users that could promote your business. That is of coarse if your users are people getting married. Your venues might book more birthdays than weddings. Thats why the research is important.<p>Hope this helps!"

"We have partnered with a startup (we&#x27;ll announce who soon enough) who shared a lot of ideas about chip to chip I&#x2F;O with myself. While they call it a SerDes, it is infact a source synchronous (clock forwarded) link that is 5 bits over 6 wires. It is silicon proven, and is capable of up to 125Gb&#x2F;s over 12mm while being a little over 10x more energy efficient (in terms of pJ&#x2F;bit) than other available VSR SerDes. Obviously it is short reach over PCB, but we imagine (yet to be tested) we can extend that reach a bit more using a more exotic PCB laminate (Megtron, Rogers, etc), or going over wire (tested to go over 6 inches using a HuberSuhner SMA cable). Right now, we are only using it to go between chips in a Multi Chip Module, or under 12mm on a PCB. Big bonus is as of a month ago, it is a JEDEC standard!<p>Most of the information in the linked article is very outdated (~16 months old), so we have decided to ditch the idea of having a separate DRAM and &quot;External I&#x2F;O&quot; and just have our chip-to-chip on all four sides of the chip. The chip-to-chip interface uses the same protocol as our Network On Chip, and expands in the same 2D mesh. We are also looking into (with a sketched out plan) on how to directly interface this I&#x2F;O with HBM dies that can be in the same MCM package. As far as supporting other memories&#x2F;IOs, we are leaning towards having &quot;adapter chips&quot; that would convert our chip-to-chip interface to DDR4, Ethernet, Infiniband, etc.<p>As far as bandwidth numbers, our aggregate bandwidth for this test chip we have just taped out (16 cores + 2 chip-to-chip I&#x2F;O macros on TSMC 28nm, 12mm^2 in size) is 60GB&#x2F;s though for the planned production chip, we will be over 256GB&#x2F;s.

"Start watching the complexity of energy management in a cell or how the immune system works or how cancer cells implement countermeasures to bypass all of the evolved mechanisms against it (yet remain viable).  It&#x27;s beyond ridiculous<p>Honestly I just struggle with the overall statistical likelihood of life evolving. I&#x27;ve tried to get folks to engage on my thinking here but it never happens. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m off.<p>One example.  The number of interactions per second in water is roughly the mean molecular velocity divided by the mean free path times the number of molecules. For a mole of water (~18g) that&#x27;s approximately 590 m&#x2F;s * 1&#x2F;3.1e-10m * 6.02e23 or ~1.15e36 interactions per second. Per kg of water that&#x27;s ~1.15e36 * (1000&#x2F;18) = ~6.4e37. Given that most chemical reactions related to the formation of life are going to happen in solution in water, this seems like a reasonable place to start on this journey.<p>Expanded across all of the water and entire biomass of the earth (in kg) for 5 billion years, this is 1.15e36&#x2F;kgs * (1.4e18kg + 6e14kg) * (360024365*5e9)s = 2.5e71 potentially life-forming molecular interactions in water on planet earth&#x27;s history. We&#x27;re just spitballing here so let&#x27;s square that to account for any bullshit that I missed.<p>6.25e142 &#x27;interesting&#x27; molecular interactions on earth since it was a sphere of magma.<p>I know this is broken but just roll with the idea for a second.<p>Given 6.25e142 molecular interactions total, let&#x27;s assume that&#x27;s the upper bound of base pairs of DNA stacking on each other (reality is obviously many many many order of magnitudes less). A+C+A+G, then A+C+A+T, then A+C+T+A, etc etc. Let&#x27;s further assume that the absolute minimum number of base pairs required for a critter to reproduce is 1&#x2F;10 the smallest observed genome. The smallest i can find is Carsonella ruddi with 160k base pairs. Let&#x27;s split that down to 16k base pairs just for shits and giggles and assume that most of it can be random and still result in a living reproducing organism. The only constraint i&#x27;m going to ask for is that there are one or more critical sections that need to be reasonably correct for the DNA to be viable.<p>The question is what is the likelyhood that all of these interactions are going to create one of those critical sections?<p>There are four nucleotides that make up dna, commonly labled as A, C, G and T. The possible combinations of these nucleotides grow exponentially with the length of the sequence. 4 base pairs have 4^4 combinations, 10 base pairs have 4^10 combinations. etc etc.  What if we assume perfectly uniform distribution of random variations (obviously broken), what&#x27;s the maximum length of &#x27;critical section&#x27; that we can guarantee will get at least one shot at life.<p>log₄(6.25e140)=237<p>237 nucleotides is the limit to where our mythical mix master could explore all possible combinations and any one of those has a 100% chance of being realized.  (Keep in mind that this is individual nucleotides, not genes.  A single gene typically starts at 1000 nucleotides, our &#x27;most simple organism&#x27; Carsonella ruddi has 160,000 base pairs, and the human genome has ~3 billion base pairs.)<p>What this tells me is that you cannot have a &#x27;critical section&#x27; in ANY gene or DNA sequence that is more than 237 nucleotides long and attribute the source of that sequence as some kind of statistical certainty...from there it starts to become a function of chance.  The degree to which it is chance depends on what kind of sequence you need to find to get life moving.  (ANd this is completely ignoring the fact that DNA is not living, it needs all sorts of mechanisms around it to actually function)  This is all true also if you limit the scope of your investigation to the planet earth.<p>If you expand it to all of the atoms across the entire universe assuming it&#x27;s one giant blob of water, just expand the middle term from ~1.5e18kg to 1.5e53kg and the length to 15 billion years. You wind up with max critical section length of 355 nucleotides.<p>Again i&#x27;m sure something is wrong with my thinking.  But my mental model is that we are operating somewhere along an infinite stream of events of trillions of universes and we are unbelievably special&#x2F;unique.  OR the universe is much more bizarre than we even remotely understand.<p>¯\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯"

"You are again conflating high bandwidth and low latency.<p>&gt; So to not be memory bound you need to run an extra 15 times more instructions... without adding any cache misses, just to execute one instruction per cycle (a fraction of the possible). If it&#x27;s less you are memory bound.<p>Yes, if you do operations in a lineal access pattern like this the performance will be bound by the bandwidth. This is the situation I was referring to above.<p>&gt; Now imagine it&#x27;s not perfectly sequential, and instead you have to retrieve something from memory before you know where to go next. Like say a database index, binary tree, or linked list. Instead of getting 8 bytes @ 2400 Mhz you get 8 bytes per 70 ns. Keep in mind that&#x27;s 8 bytes per 1&#x2F;2.4 ns vs 70 or 168 times worse.<p>&gt; Suddenly instead of needing 15 times more instructions you need 2500 instructions per memory load, all without a extra cache miss.<p>&gt; So as you can see it can be quite easy to be memory limited.<p>No, in this case you will not be limited by the bandwidth, but by the latency. Having more bandwidth will do nothing, because at 8 bytes per 70 ns you&#x27;re only moving about 109 MiB&#x2F;s. If 100% of the memory accesses are cache misses (they won&#x27;t be) and the application uses all cores then yes, doubling the number of memory channels will double the multi-thread performance (unless channel count = core count), although the single-threaded performance will stay unchanged. Additionally, in this particular load you could get away with relatively low frequency RAM, which won&#x27;t significantly affect the latency but will lower the total bandwidth (it will still be way higher than 109 MiB&#x2F;s) and will be cheaper."

We were also part of the batch of people that got banned for uploading Metallica mp3s.

"There were (maybe still are) tons of such mesh networks run by small commercial operators in Germany&#x27;s rural areas, usually using directional radio to create connections between villages and then meshing all the wifi consumer routers to span wifi over the village. They did that&#x2F;do that because the major commercial providers (i.e. Telekom) weren&#x27;t exactly fast laying fiber to these villages.<p>A buddy of mine used to run such a network spanning 3 villages with about 400 customers a bunch of years back. I seem to remember one of the directional antennas was strategically placed in some church tower.<p>They ran this as a two people operation. Extreme weather also was a problem for them, and they essentially learned network design by trial and error, starting out as a fully bridged network where everybody was in the same 10.0.0.0&#x2F;8, NATed to the outside. They fixed that later. Customers only got like 3-4MBit&#x2F;s from this mesh, which wasn&#x27;t exactly fast but not too shabby either back then, especially considering the only alternative those villagers had was ISDN speeds (128kbit&#x2F;s max I think). No LTE yet either.<p>They weren&#x27;t alone either. There was a huge number of such operators who shared knowledge etc.<p>Once he started negotiating with those villages to lay fiber and provide DSL service all of the sudden the Telekom started fibering up &quot;his&quot; villages."

"They don&#x27;t help on large volumes of data which cannot fit into GPU memory.  Obviously.  PCIe is even slower than standard CPU memory, pulling non-trivial amounts of data across the PCIe bus is catastrophic for any GPU program.<p>GPUs shine because their VRAM has enormous volumes of bandwidth (up to ~512 GB&#x2F;s for high-end modern GPUs).  That&#x27;s an order of magnitude more than CPU memory.<p>So basically you throw indexes and perhaps a few key columns in VRAM, but as little actual data as possible, and just return the row IDs (or ranges) of interesting data.  That lets you cross-reference back into host memory, and at that point you would perhaps perform some further limitation criteria based on something that&#x27;s not available in GPU memory.<p>GPU memory isn&#x27;t super-abundant, but high-end cards have up to 24 GB, and if you stack a bunch of them in a rack then you are talking about a reasonable amount of memory for most use-cases.  Four cards in a box is easy, and you can put four cards in a 1U chassis if you use GP100 mezzanine cards.  So now we&#x27;re talking 96GB of VRAM per box or per 1U, which works out to quite a bit of index data.<p>The other use-case would be something that&#x27;s really computationally intensive to perform, but for some reason cannot be pre-computed and cached.  So - for example find me all rows where &quot;sha256(INTEGER my_table.my_val AND now() AS INTEGER) &gt; 256&quot;.  Which as you can imagine mostly trends towards crypto kinds of stuff."

There are lots of villages and small towns in industrialised countries where the highest speed you can currently get is in the low single-digit MBit&#x2F;s. Loads of people currently have no good internet access options but could afford SpaceX&#x27;s service (based on what&#x27;s publicly known about it, the estimates I&#x27;ve seen are that it will likely cost something between $50 and $100 per month). It would also be extremely interesting to businesses in such areas (Germany has quite a few of these, for example).<p>I think there might just be enough potential customers in sparsely populated areas to make this a profitable service.

Back when I bought my jalapenos they were only $150 and I chose not to do the upgraded pricing to 7GH&#x2F;s for $100.

On the other hand I still have only received part of my order and am waiting on multiple 60GH&#x2F;s units that are just now starting to ship to people who ordered in June 2012.  Depending on how long it takes them to get to my order I may have some regrets I didn&#x27;t just order all jalapenos instead.

The only reason b&#x2F;s has an bps alias is to reduce confusion. Greater hamming distance means less potential for confusion.<p>Now you want to add the confusion back. Luckily, units are standardised by international bodies, not individuals, and the industry seems to be happy with the standards and uses them. Very seldom I have seen kBps (and in the few cases where I have seen it, it was wrong anyway). kb&#x2F;s, while correct, I have only seen used by mistake, or by malice (e.g. ISPs intentionally misleading customers). Luckily, most professionals agree on only using B&#x2F;s and bps, and no other combination, correct or not."
"Take when someone streams on youtube - it is exactly that. Ability to stream video live, let your viewers chat amongst eachother + being able to receive donations. With Youtube becoming more Goolag than before, and because Youtube is actively becoming platfrom just like any other where they don&#x27;t share profits with creators anymore, I storngly believe this is where it&#x27;s going to be &quot;at&quot; for startups. I already looked into it and I believe the issue with large data storage and traffic is now solved with cheap hardware AND P2P streaming like bittorent and the js client for the web browser.<p>Then you can see that YT creators now rival TV - easily. So I believe the internet will transform in a way where an youtube channel will become something like a tv show or late night show or whatever TV equivalent from the past. People will be actively looking and subscribing to these individuals or shows on purpose and will be consuming them periodically like they did in the past with television. Hence video is the tech I&#x27;d look into and the concept of making good platform&#x2F;s for creators and viewers to connect and interact(!).<p>Blogs are dead. FB is good only for groups(many people in one place with many interests can easily connect). Twitter is pure pollitical cancer. Instagram is just for worshipping attention whores..eh &quot;models&quot;. Any non-mainstream social network became too singular because people who were kicked out form ms sn went there. So all in all, social networks are dead. But video, video is a medium that is too deeply rooted in humans for some reason. I guess the ease of consumption? So I stirngly believe that is the way to go. I mean, you have hundreds of streaming services nowadays...no one will be buying all of them. People still want to consume good content but TV is shite and these online stremaing service will become unafordable. So there will have to be alternatives for people and as I have mentioned, YT is cutting sharing of profits with creators(not to mention censorship), so these creators will be looking for alternative means of earning and creating and sharing.<p>(I didn&#x27;t proof-read my response so sorry for typos, I type fast and don&#x27;t have time for this)"

"Servicing HST with a Soyuz is basically impossible. Hubble is in a higher altitude orbit in a significantly lower inclination than the launch site for crewed Soyuz vehicles. To perform the plane change maneuver (of 23 deg.) would require a delta-V of 1.5 km&#x2F;s (20% of the orbital velocity at the typical Soyuz destination altitude). That would require bringing nearly 4 tonnes of extra propellant onboard the Soyuz, which isn&#x27;t feasible. Additionally, this doesn&#x27;t include the added weight of the docking adapter and Hubble replacement parts that would need to be brought along.<p>It&#x27;s conceivable that a repair mission might be possible with the soon to come into service US crew capsules (Dragon 2 and Starliner) since the rockets that launch them have more performance than the Soyuz, but even then it would be a pretty ambitious mission."

"IRT to applying ultra-high bandwidth networks to devices which don&#x27;t need a lot of bandwidth, the point of moving to a higher bandwidth network is to allow these devices to quickly report back what they want to say and then get off the air faster. The faster they can report their small heartbeat of data, the more devices you can support. Lets assume this traffic light sends a snapshot of the intersection at a frame a second, each frame being 100KB. So, 100KB&#x2F;s would be is normal load, so there&#x27;s no real need for it to have a dedicated 100Mbit link. However, if you&#x27;ve got a few thousand devices wanting to share that link space, you&#x27;re going to need more bandwidth available to the whole. Its also good for the general responsiveness of the network for that 100KB transfer to happen in less time, as only a single device can talk on the network at once. Its the same thing with home WiFi connectivity. 54Mbit would theoretically be plenty of bandwidth for a movie stream and a few phones&#x2F;tablets browsing social media, but if you&#x27;re using 802.11g you&#x27;ll probably have issues with your video stream as those phones and tablets hog the airwaves while they load a batch of images. It takes time servicing multiple devices in the same channel, time that takes away from max effective bandwidth available.<p>Also, while its true one could just wire up all of these fixed devices, these wiring costs would massively drive up the cost of implementation. Trenching city streets to lay new cables costs a lot of money, just ask Google."

"Apparently they have several benchmarks where they claim that decompression is faster than memcpy (!).<p>However, this is only the case because on several Intel x86_64 benchmarks they report memcpy performance between 5-10 GB&#x2F;s, while even a basic DDR3 dual channel arch has 20 GB&#x2F;s memory bandwidth, while a modern quad channel DDR4 can have 76.8 GB&#x2F;s bandwidth, and of course there is no reason for memcpy to be substantially slower than memory bandwidth assuming it&#x27;s properly implemented (AVX can separately read two and write one 256-bit per cycle = 128 GB&#x2F;s memcpy at 4GHz).<p>Am I missing something or is this another case of &quot;implausible claims = they screwed the benchmark = they are incompetent&#x2F;malicious&quot;?"

"It&#x27;s really <i>expensive</i> for companies, too. The company I work for (small to medium sized) has a 34&#x2F;34 Mbit&#x2F;s fiber connection and it costs us 600€ per month. Included are 8 IPv4 addresses and an 8h response time (which has never been met and when we sued after a week of non-working internet, we lost in court).<p>It&#x27;s just ridiculous how expensive it is for businesses. We simply cannot afford a 100&#x2F;100 MBit&#x2F;s connection and we are located in a larger city near the center, not even in a rural area that needs an extra fiber just for us.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise that German companies are so much behind Americans in the tech sector.

"You&#x27;ve got some confusion there. The 11km&#x2F;s escape velocity from Earth is how much the Earth&#x27;s gravity slows you down as you leave it. When you reach escape velocity, it doesn&#x27;t mean you leave the Earth&#x27;s influence with 11km&#x2F;s. It means that if you&#x27;re going 11km&#x2F;s near the Earth, you&#x27;ll leave the Earth&#x27;s influence before you fall back down. If you just barely escape, your velocity relative to the Earth will be small.<p>What does matter is Earth&#x27;s orbital speed, though. That counts towards the 42km&#x2F;s you need to escape from the Sun, assuming you&#x27;re smart enough to launch in the direction of the Earth&#x27;s motion. That means you only need 12km&#x2F;s additional velocity, whereas you need to cancel out virtually all of that 30km&#x2F;s velocity to fall into the Sun."

I&#x27;d argue the best way to stop thinking about something, is to divert your mental focus to other thing&#x2F;s intentionally. Best way to stop thinking about your ex?

In fact, that&#x27;s the worst thing you can do. You can only focus on one thing at a time, and your brain is finite, as such it&#x27;s not that difficult to saturate it and drown out competing thoughts. Given enough effort and time, the bear is banished from your short term memory and its emotional hold on you is dramatically lessened. After a while you then realize that it has in fact been a long time since you&#x27;ve thought about the bear, and you realize said bear&#x27;s hold over you is no more. All accomplished without constantly thinking about whether you&#x27;re thinking about the bear."

"Thanks for the reply. This is mostly a thought experiment in can you &#x27;grep the web&#x27; (without indexing etc).<p>If you split 24TB across ~128 servers ( so filling up 256 GB RAM per server) you would have to search 256 GB of RAM in 100ms, or ~2.5TB&#x2F;sec. Unfrotunately most RAM will give you only 20GB&#x2F;s (DDR4 3200：25.6 GB&#x2F;s) . Multi-core setups do not help much as they share memory channels (for example AMD&#x27;s latest 64 core &#x27;monster&#x27; has only 4 shared memmory channels).

"In the past, GPUs weren&#x27;t that practical for big data, since they offered a lot of CPU power, but not much in the way of I&#x2F;O.  It&#x27;s possible that PCI-e 3.0 and 4.0 will change that, since they supposedly offer up to 15 GB&#x2F;s and 31 GB&#x2F;s bandwidth.<p>Big data is more than just querying.  There are people running fancy machine learning algorithms.  Those are the people most likely to use the flexibility of having a Java (or other programming language) interface.<p>I&#x27;m curious why you think FPGAs will win over GPUs in HPC.  I struggle to imagine academics writing Verilog or VHDL.  I can just barely see them sending in legions of grad students to try to write CUDA or OpenCL, but RTL design seems a bridge too far.

"You see this all over the place, e.g. cache-aware, SIMD-friendly approaches often win out over asymptotically better algorithms on real hardware for small to medium problem sizes.<p>At large problem sizes a lot of effort has already been put into using the optimal algorithm. If simulations take days you&#x27;re grateful for any constant factor improvements.<p>Asymptotic computational complexity does matter, but it only tells you how far you can push the problem. It tells you such things as &quot;cracking this cipher is practically infeasible even if you turned the whole universe into a computer&quot;, &quot;problem can only be approximated&quot;, &quot;sometimes will not get a result at all&quot; or &quot;so ridiculously simple that we can run this on terabytes of data within minutes&quot;.

"A hundred cycles to zero a page? If 4 KB can be written in a hundred cycles then, assuming a 3 GHz processor, that&#x27;s 30 million pages per second or ~120 GB&#x2F;s. That&#x27;s pretty fast memory. On x86&#x2F;x64 processors, which lack a zero-the-cacheline instruction, the memory will also end up being read, so you need 240 GB&#x2F;s to clear pages that quickly. This ignores the cost of TLB misses, which require further memory accesses."
"It&#x27;s amazing that modem speeds reached 56Kb&#x2F;s over analog lines that were digitized at 64Kb&#x2F;s. Especially since T1 carrier systems stole one low-order bit in every other sample for control purposes. That&#x27;s an incredible accomplishment of signal processing.  As late as the mid-1970s, it was believed to be theoretically impossible. Bell Labs once did a study that concluded that 19Kb&#x2F;s was the upper limit for analog phone lines.<p>It&#x27;s also impressive that the modem negotiation process worked as well as it did, across many vendors and generations of modems.<p>When the modems agree on a good high-speed mode, the data sounds like white noise.  That&#x27;s proper. Any modulation scheme which doesn&#x27;t sound like white noise is wasting bandwidth.  Carriers and tones waste energy but carry no payload data.<p>This, incidentally, is a critique of SETI.  For a long time, the SETI crowd was looking for &quot;carriers&quot;, signals with a big fixed-frequency component.  Carriers are obsolete.  Other than legacy analog broadcast stations, almost nothing with high power today transmits a strong carrier signal.  So SETI was looking for civilizations that used high power analog radio."

"The mentioned loop around the pole attached to your waist would do but since none of the extremely detailed drawings contained the loop we must assume that the person travaled the pole without the loop.<p>Moon orbits Earth at about 1km&#x2F;s and you have to loose orbital speed as you move along the pole.<p>Since the pole distance is about 400000km and the orbital speed to loose is 1km&#x2F;s it means you need to loose about 2.5mm&#x2F;s for every km of the pole that you travel. It may not sound much, but if you propel yourself along the pole in the direction of Earth at L1 you would be surprised to find yourself travelling away from the pole at 2.5mm&#x2F;s after 1km.  If you push yourself hard at say 36km&#x2F;h (or 10m&#x2F;s) and decide to get some sleep then you would travel almost 290km but you would also find yourself moving away from the pole at almost 1m&#x2F;s and at about 10km from the pole."

Personally my experiences have been the complete opposite. There are a number of reasons paper books are always going to be second to ebooks to me. The idea of lugging a book&#x2F;s around. Hunting for a book at a shop or library when I&#x27;m feeling the itch to read it sooner rather than later. Flipping through pages whilst looking back up at a screen breaks my concentration. etc..<p>When the first gen Kindle was released I ordered it right away. It was one of the most liberating devices I&#x27;ve ever owned. I managed to read a ton of books that had been on my read-list for ages. This obviously has much more to do with having everything you want to read immediately available and also the discrete portability to do such.<p>Also when I would underline text in a book it was as if my brain shutoff. Subconsciously i&#x27;m thinking &#x27;Okay I saved this part in the book&#x27;. When I&#x27;d go back my train of thought is gone and thus the highlight is out of context. So that bit of physicality returns zero for me personally.

Development has slowed down over the past year unfortunately. One of the most notable contributions recently was the addition of GSS API support. Overall the API is pretty small and easy to learn.

It&#x27;s also pretty fast and can easily process 1M msg&#x2F;s if you need that. I would ignore the czmq API entirely and only use the core API and roll your own stuff around it

"They might have phrased this poorly.<p>&gt;We should support at least 100,000 simultaneous users.<p>This line makes me think that this is what they expected the peak (or near peak) to be.<p>&gt;Users can place one tile every 5 minutes, so we must support an average update rate of 100,000 tiles per 5 minutes (333 updates&#x2F;s).<p>So assuming that they mean that 100k is the peak and that clients are limited to 1 update per 5 minutes, they can expect 333 updates per second on average.  The &quot;average&quot; is taken over this 5 minute period.  This average represents the number of queries per second they will get if everyone&#x27;s 5 minute cooldown is spread out evenly over each 5 minute period.<p>It is possible, for example, for half of the peak population&#x27;s cooldown to expire at 1300 and the other half to expire at 1305.  In this case the average updates&#x2F;s over the 5 minute period from 1300-1305 would still be 333 updates&#x2F;s even though there were really 2 bursts of 50k a second at 1300 and 1305.  It&#x27;s far more likely that cooldowns are not excessively stacked in this way, so you prepare for the average and hope for the best."

"&gt; On a mobile device in India? Nonsense. Your page load time is dominated by latency, which the AMP user doesn&#x27;t see because it is preloaded from near caches.<p>My test device is a Huawei Ideos X3 on a 56kbit&#x2F;s throttled 3G connection. The same effect also applies with a Pixel 1 on the same connection, or either of the devices on a modern 3.9G LTE connection. (Tested on O2 net in Germany, works reliably better than AMP even and especially while on a train — if you&#x27;ve ever tried using O2 on the intercity train between Hamburg and Münster you know that every third world country has better internet than, I&#x27;ve seen 8kbps with 13 seconds latency there)<p>&gt; Which of the JS is unnecessary? The JS to load images allows AMP not to preload images below the fold, which is absolutely necessary for speed and for being friendly to data plans.<p>AMP uses megabytes of JS for that purpose, I do the same in under 1kiB (even including an intersection observer polyfill). And my CSS is much much smaller as well. Part of why I get a 100&#x2F;100 in all pagespeed and lighthouse tests, including when simulating mobile connections, while AMP pages get only 60&#x2F;100.<p>&gt; Explain. You still get first party tracking that gets fired when the user clicks to your page and can get user consent via data-consent-notification-id.<p>I want JS-free analytics that do not require tracking or any consent (GDPR allows collecting some information without consent, same with the yet unreleased ePrivacy directive with which AMP is not compliant anyway)."

"You are right.   The largest Xeon Phi&#x27;s have 16GB of GDDR5 memory on the card, and the 31S1P on sale has 8GB.   The quoted speeds are for 16-channel transfer between the card&#x27;s on board memory and the cores on the same card.  Transfer from main memory back and forth to the card is over PCIe v2 x16 which has a theoretical max of 8 GB&#x2F;s --- about 3% of the maximum transfer rate on data within the card.<p>So if your working data set fits on the card (less than 8&#x2F;16 GB), or can be partitioned so that it fits on multiple cards, you can potentially get great performance from Phi.  But if it&#x27;s larger than this, especially if it is less than 1TB and would thus fit in the host&#x27;s RAM, transfer from the host to the card will likely destroy any performance advantage."

"&gt; I&#x27;m now paying $60 for 250MB&#x2F;s down<p>LOL. My mom lives in an older house in a formerly-rural area where she&#x27;s now surrounded by suburb-style new development. She wanted cable internet, and it cost her about $8000 and endless hours of haranguing Cox and chasing down service vans just to get a hook up. Literally she would see a Cox van at a construction site and stop and ask the person, because no one would talk to her on the phone. She eventually found one guy who gave her his business card and cell number, and knew a few people in the construction department who would help. The woman who took her credit card number over the phone to charge for the service told her she knew absolutely nothing about the process, and could make no guarantees about when it would happen. My mom was so desperate, she gave her her credit card number anyway. It took nearly a year to run maybe 100 yards of cable down her driveway from the street to her house, but she finally does have broadband now."

"No, the house is too low behind a low hill for a short mast, and a very high mast wouldn&#x27;t be ok.  The way to do it would be 4G at the top of the hill and a cable or relay to the house, but as it&#x27;s a populated village that would need cooperation among residents.<p>If there was plenty of cooperation and interest among the residents, they could install a better shared solution for the whole village than 4G even.  There was a company willing to install something like that.  But not enough people signed up to make it worthwhile.<p>I agree with you about 4G.  I switched from ADSL+ to 4G last year in the middle of a city, and it&#x27;s been a good improvement in download speeds, and an x10 improvement in upload.  Netflix works excellently.  Though there tend to be latency spikes, and new connections to websites for some reason are quite slow.  I actually switched to save costs - unlimited data on 4G was less than half the price of bottom-of-the-range ADSL too.<p>When I want the best connection out of every option, such as a big download.  I switch to my mobile phone, which seems perverse but there we are.  I get ~90Mbit&#x2F;s download via my phone.  It&#x27;s faster than wifi at the office, faster than ADSL, and faster than 4G at home too - the phone has a better modem than the standalone 4G router.<p>However I&#x27;ve tried 4G in London, which is the largest city in the UK, and it was awfully slow there.  Too much density I suspect.  So it&#x27;s not a solution for everywhere.  I think I&#x27;m lucky with it where I live.  Around the same city, there are plenty of &quot;notspot&quot; shadows where there&#x27;s no signal, not even 3G."

"As long as you launch an object capable of aerodynamic control (glider), you can compensate for wind by launching with excess energy&#x2F;speed. Launching could be easy by a catapult of a couple hundred meters (50m distance for 100m&#x2F;s speed gives 10g, 200m distance for 200m&#x2F;s gives those same 10g.<p>My best idea would be a flywheel, because for 5kg mass (including a sled&#x2F;rope), and assuming force-limited operation, you&#x27;d need 100kW peak power at the end for the 200m long 200m&#x2F;s exit speed installation.<p>Spin the flywheel, and engage a clutch to connect it with a winch that pulls the sled via a (Dyneema) rope. There are magnetic clutches that provide precise control over the force, allowing it to run the glider&#x2F;rope near their structural limits.<p>Rough, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest viability of 25m long catapults that launch suitable freight at ~200m&#x2F;s, but &quot;suitable&quot; here means ~100g, likely requiring fancy rigid foam fillers for the box and limiting to sufficiently solid freight.<p>If you figure out how to dig a 100~400m deep, 2~3m diameter hole cheaply, you could save massive horizontal space. Launching out of an elevator shaft of a highrise or on the wall of a tall building could be practical, too. Just drag a thin rope up behind the sled, and use it to pull the main rope back up. The sled should be far too light on it&#x27;s own. Click&#x2F;hook in the next glider, while getting the flywheel back up to speed. This should allow 10~20s spacing on a single sled&#x2F;guide, and up to ~2s if you robot-mount the glider fast enough to the next sled on an array of parallel guide rails. As soon as one glider clears the launch space, the next one could be moved in. That&#x27;d be important to the economics of building &#x2F; converting a tower for such a use case.<p>And even if the contents require long (and thus horizontal) catapults, it might be feasible to launch the empty glider from much smaller (50m vertical would also solve most clearance issues) facilities to use most of the range for actual delivery."

"Right, though the issue is not much about risk and complexity, but rather by sheer power needed to push the air in a tunnel.<p>The smaller the tunnel is, the smaller is the size of the ventilation tubes that can be used, and thus you need more power to push the air inside.<p>The amount of air needed by an electric motor is &quot;0&quot;, whilst the amount of air needed by a combustion engine is something that needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis, normally  the rule of the thumb is 4 cubic meters per minute for each Diesel HP (i.e. with kW&#x27;s 5.4&#x2F;KW).<p>And you have to assure anywyay some air to the people, usually 3 cubic meters per person per minute is used.<p>And there is anywyay a limit to the pressure with which you can pump air in, because the &quot;return speed&quot; is usually limited to a maximum of 0.5 m&#x2F;s (as higher speed may cause the transportation of dust and particles).<p>And then of course the longer the tunnel is the more powerful must the ventilating fans be, we are talking of several hundreds of kW to power these fans."

"With ion engines, you need fuel to be ionized - usually xenon. The faster you want to go, the more of your energy just goes toward accelerating the fuel in your tank.

So if you had, e.g. two TB3 external drives, you could plug one into the dock, and one into the other port on the Mac.

This is... true... but your intuitions as to the forces involved are badly off. Let&#x27;s run the numbers for 16 Psyche real quick.

Assume they&#x27;re making a solid 50km&#x2F;s exhaust velocity, the top end for ion propulsion. And, just for fun, include 10,000,000,000,000 metric tons of xenon. This is a pretty big spacecraft, but it&#x27;s a thousandth the size of 16 Psyche. (2.27×10^19 kg)<p>Light off the thrusters, and run them until they use up all the xenon. It&#x27;ll take a while. 63,218,390,804 years, in fact. (870 tonnes per 5.5 years) But, good news! After that burn, you&#x27;ve added 0.05km&#x2F;s to 16 Psyche&#x27;s orbital velocity.

"&quot;a rocket takes off. let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s going upwards at 1 m&#x2F;s at some short time after takeoff. why can&#x27;t it then reduce (not to zero) acceleration such that it stays going upwards at 1 m&#x2F;s all the way out of the gravity well? don&#x27;t aim for escape velocity, keep the velocity at exactly 1 m&#x2F;s until you&#x27;re out.&quot;  &lt;-- that will totally work, but isn&#x27;t escape velocity.<p>Escape velocity is essentially the velocity an object must start out with to move towards an asymptotically infinite distance from the gravity well without additional thrust. That last bit is what makes it escape velocity. The gravity well will slow the object to near zero velocity but the object&#x27;s distance will eventually overcome the gravity before it reaches zero or negative velocity.<p>Your example of moving at a constant speed of 1 m&#x2F;s is only achievable with constant thrust to cancel gravity, thereby stopping the object from slowing during its ascent. If the object has achieved its escape velocity, no additional thrust is needed. One is not better than the other, it&#x27;s just a matter of what is more practical in terms of fuel or travel time."

"There are actually a fair few problems with SI units. The candela is fairly ridiculous, the kilogram needs to not depend on a physical object (it&#x27;s also a little silly to have a prefixed base unit). The ampere is not practical to measure with its current definition, and apparently with the current definitions of Hz and radians, 1 Hz = 1&#x2F;s = 1 radians&#x2F;second. Other people take issue with the mole, as well.<p>SI is an improvement but it is not quite perfect. As long as we have a choice of imperfect systems, we have to pick which is most convenient."

All you&#x27;d have in that scenario would be the rate of change of AC, which would be 10A at 50Hz = 2000 A&#x2F;s in Australia (1Hz = +240 to -240 and back in 1s).<p>I&#x27;m sure this is hopelessly simplistic though, nothing happens instantaneously - there will be some period of high-resistance arking, etc."

"Can you provide a link to this please? My current knowledge is that all numpy data lives in memory, and pandas itself has a feature to fragment any data into iterables so I can read upto my memory limit. I cannot use this feature due to the serial nature of some of the operations that I alluded to (I&#x27;d have to almost rewrite the entire library for some of these complicated operations like groupby and sorting).<p>I do have fast SSD storage because it&#x27;s on the scratch drive of a cluster and from what I&#x27;ve seen it can do ~300-400 MB&#x2F;s easily.

But like I said, I work with a less-than-stellar set of tools and I have to literally set up a postgres server from ground up to write to it. Which shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal except when it&#x27;s on a non-root user and I have to keep remapping dependencies (took 5-6 hours to set it up on the instance I have access to).<p>My other option was to write the entire 250 GB to a sqllite database using the sqlalchemy library in Python, but that seems to fail whether I do it with parallel writes, or serial writes.

"I would say go for it.<p>From my experience, a company can&#x27;t be partially remote. Fully remote is a much better option.<p>Communication breaks down when you do partial remote. Some people would attend physical meetings. The remote ones are out of the loop and a separate remote &#x27;meeting&#x27; is needed to update them. The non-remote people are also very unlikely to get on Slack, Jira, or whatever. It falls apart, and you end up with non-remote people handholding the remote ones.<p>The one fully remote team I worked with was extremely productive. Our Slack had about 20,000 messages a day. People were very good friends with each other; it&#x27;s amazing how shitposting at 4 AM builds relationships faster than face to face conversation.<p>We didn&#x27;t even need meetings.

You&#x27;ll be hiring from a different pool of recruits, the ones who prefer remote.<p>I&#x27;m in the office before sunrise, back home at sunset. 7 to 7 sounds crazy, but there are naps in between, playing with the kids, and plenty of rest. I know a guy who does two 3 hour batches in the day, and 2 hours at night, and does grocery shopping or laundry in between, during his rest. You also get the night owls who are happy working 6 PM to 6 AM.<p>For that reason, we had stand up meetings at 6 PM, where one group clocked out and another group clocked in. Side benefit was that we could assign one group work at night and the management team did code reviews in the morning. When the night team was exhausted, a fresh pair of eyes might spot a solution they didn&#x27;t see, and vice versa.<p>p&#x2F;s if you want to leave a country just to avoid taxes, Malaysia offers entrepreneur visas.

"There’s no real concept of “faster” exhaust compared to yourself.  The speed of the exhaust is relative to the frame of reference of your rocket which is an accelerating frame, that speed is always the same when measured against the stationary rocket in that frame.  When measured from a fixed inertial frame the speed changes as your rocket accelerates.<p>For a more concrete example, for a moon rocket the speed of the rocket exhaust is around 3 or 4 km&#x2F;s. On the ground the speed of the rocket is obviously 0, in low earth orbit the speed of the rocket is 7 or 8 km&#x2F;s, and to initiate the transfer orbit to the moon you have to accelerate to about 10 km&#x2F;s. (these would all be in earth centered, nonrotating frame speed measurements)<p>The rocket exhaust doesn’t have to get faster to get you to those higher speeds because you’re taking it with you.<p>The more you can increase the rocket exhaust relative to yourself though, the more efficient your rocket is."

"<i>By throwing away TCP, they are throwing away decades of optimisations, and hardware offloading that network hardware makers made to handle TCP well</i><p>Indeed.

We use FreeBSD, ngnix &amp; TCP, and make heavy use of offloads like async sendfile(), TSO, LRO, kTLS and more recently hardware kTLS offload.<p>Right now, I have a single socket 32c&#x2F;64t AMD Rome server delivering over 350Gb&#x2F;s of real Netflix customer traffic.  This traffic is all TLS encrypted, and is served across hundreds of thousands of TCP connections.<p>From measurements we&#x27;ve done, current QUIC would cost about 3x as much as TCP when using software crypto.

"PCIe 3.0 does not have a very high transaction cost. The encoding overhead is just 1.5%, and the protocol is quite simple for the primary communication (there&#x27;s a bunch of &quot;extras&quot; like retransmits and stuff, but that&#x27;s not important here).<p>I can say that the PCIe x16 cards we develop at work have no problem reaching the theoretical maximum, transmitting around 15GB&#x2F;s worth of payload data (e.g. our 2x100Gb&#x2F;s NIC with one port pushing 100Gb&#x2F;s in both directions, and another a few tens of Gb&#x2F;s in both directions). We don&#x27;t make cards smaller than x8, so I can&#x27;t give <i>measured</i> numbers there, but Intel should have no problem transmitting ~4GB&#x2F;s on that x4.<p>NVMe surely has an overhead, but this overhead is far from interesting, unless you are implying that the overhead eats a whopping 35% of the available bandwidth. Likewise, if Intel had hit a PCIe&#x2F;NVMe bottle-neck, going to up x8 would not not have been difficult in any way (x16 is more annoying, though).<p>The performance has either been restricted by the flash itself, or by the controller—not by the interface. The numbers are also small enough that the software side shouldn&#x27;t be a problem yet. Attaching to the memory bus minimizes penalties that are unlikely to be a bottle-neck."

It took a good 45 seconds to install the memory, and I&#x27;d wager anyone could do it (it&#x27;s on the &#x27;underside&#x27; of the motherboard, all by itself, and has a little chart on the memory cover to tell you exactly what slots to use based on how many modules you have).<p>And then I bought a 4x M.2 PCIe card and populated it with 2TB SSDs (that exceed the Apple, with sustained R&#x2F;W of 4500MB&#x2F;s according to Blackmagic) for just around $1,100, versus the $2,000 Apple wanted.

The unit was otherwise running fine the following day but ISDN was stuck. We never got this  to repeat at other times.  If you booted it at midnight and came to work at 6AM, it was stuck. But it would run OK from 6AM to midnight so it wasn&#x27;t any buffer overflow or such.<p>So, eventually, just decided to stay at lab for the night. At 5AM the air conditioning came on (it was shut for the night). The ISDN circuit got stuck.<p>It was  electromagnetic interference from the massive AC unit fan which was not too far  above our lab table. Improving the grounding of the ISDN chip helped."
"The data transfer rates are what will bite you, and actually are different than advertised.<p>I know of at least one group that bought bunch of GTX970 cards because they were supposed to have same mem bw as GTX980 but just less computation power.

You can get upwards of 20gb&#x2F;s with a single core for DRAM.

MGS only weighed 1000kg too.  Maybe it could work for shipping large, pre-assembled, empty hab modules to Mars before people get there. (Low density, higher drag, no rush.)  But not practical for actual human bodies or even resupply since the Hohmann transfer takes a mere 8.5 months.  Adding an aerobraking maneuver could easily triple the transit time."

"That is why I asked, I am only aware of the use of IOPS in connection with disk I&#x2F;O and it seems a rather unusual measure for a database where caches hopefully avoid hitting the disk too often, at least for reads. And writing 8 MiB&#x2F;s assuming 4k clusters seems not really noteworthy especially given three fold redundancy. On the other hand reading 700 MiB&#x2F;s per second which would also not be affected by the redundancy seems a comparatively big number especially because caches should limit the disk traffic to a small fraction."

"Perhaps, though not really.  Commercial aircraft generally accelerate at takeoff at around 2-3m&#x2F;s.  For most people, that is quite enough, and that only gets you to 140kt.  By comparison, doing 1g for 5 seconds (being generous) only gets you to 95kt.  So you aren&#x27;t really going to be able to get much flight out of that.  More realistically, a gun would have to accelerate you to nearly the speed of sound or more.  Mannned rocket ships have a (throttled) peak acceleration of 3G, so that sets a realistic upper bound and probably way over what might be considered reasonable.  I&#x27;ve read that the Willis tower elevators accelerate downward at 8m&#x2F;s and that is uncomfortable and just for a short time.

Most of the time, only city centers have access to higher bandwidth, the outskirts, smaller cities and most of the country side have very low or no bandwidth at all. The last decades Telekom hat the monopoly with providing connectivity to homes and everyone else was a reseller. But Telekom didn&#x27;t see the need to modernize their old DSL infrastructure and were happy to let you pay 50 euros per month to provide you 16Mbit&#x2F;s.
The TV companies could provide higher bandwidth with their newer infrastructure with up to 100Mbit&#x2F;s, but the country is split between them. So when you were in a bad area, you might have Primacom as a provider and they did stop at 25Mbit&#x2F;s for a long time.
Now the situation is, that Telekom with all their money is asking the Government to pay for the renovation and they got away with it until the beginning of the year, when they finally said, that DSL will not be supported anymore. Only the fiber will now be supported. But this comes years after some villages got couple 100k Euro together to get at least 50Mbit&#x2F;s and they still pay a monthly fee of 50Euros.<p>And the Telekom is not alone with wanting support money from everyone. The southern Rheinland saw multiple providers wanting to connect villages for huge prices, which leads to the weird situation, that southern Rhineland now gets support from a Swiss company. That company doesn&#x27;t need any money and is still laying fiber through the woods to long forgotten villages.<p>Compare that with most other European countries, where you can get a fiber connection for the same money with synchronous 100Mbit&#x2F;s or more. The northern countries with their hard rock grounds did get it working in a much better way than Germany.<p>And don&#x27;t rely on LTE, as the LTE tarif were bound to lower GB&#x2F;month traffic limits and huge costs, as the LTE frequencies were auctioned of between the providers. And the winners couldn&#x27;t build where they wanted, they had to provide LTE at first where there was no mobile internet available at all, which means on the acres.<p>Germany is in a sad state in regards to connectivity. And this has nothing to do with people being afraid. If you let the monopolist do whatever it wants and not enforce the modernization, then this is what you can expect."

"I&#x27;ve said this before and now I&#x27;ll generalize my statement to say that the most important issue in the electric vehicle segment is and will be that of high power and high voltage system safety, of which the battery is one component.  If the public becomes spooked by problems and accidents in this area it could set the electric vehicle market back a decade or more.<p>The real test for electrics will come when one or two million electric vehicles of all types are sharing the road.  That&#x27;s when this issue of battery and power system safety will be hugely important.  I can imagine semi&#x27;s with a million Wh battery systems rolling down the highway.  What I cannot imagine are chain reaction collisions involving a variety of electric and liquid fuel vehicles.<p>Tesla is at the forefront of this movement, which means all eyes are on them, the arrows are on their backs and they have the burden of proof.<p>One of the most expensive types of businesses to get into are those where you have to educate your customer base before a sales pitch can even begin.  Having to educating the market before you can sell to them can seriously derail one&#x27;s focus and cost bundles of money that could be put to better use elsewhere.  I&#x27;ve been in markets like that.  It&#x27;s a horrible slog.<p>Up until now, for the most part, electrics have avoided this territory.  I fear that period is ending.  Up until now the conversations about electrics were about range and relative cost when compared to gasoline vehicles.  It feels like we are now entering the domain of having to potentially prove to the market that the technology is safe as well as to remove (or stop the potential of the development of) fears of fire and electrocution.<p>Tesla, due to their position in the market, has the honor of having all microscopes aimed at everything they do.  Every mishap is amplified.  Now that the NTSB has officially opened an investigation every afternoon news show is jumping on the issues.  It will soon be everywhere.  And Tesla now has to defend, educate and prove to the market that what they are doing is safe.<p>Competitors are now going to pull back and let Tesla take the hits.  In markets where a huge investment is required in order to educate the customer base it is often a good idea to not be a pioneer.  They will let Tesla burn reputation, bleed cash and resources to deal with the challenge of getting people to be comfortable with the technology.  In these markets letting someone else slot through this phase is often the most intelligent strategy.<p>Once things settle, competitors will come in and enjoy a market segment that has been paved flat by the pioneer&#x2F;s.  It is far less costly --at all levels-- to enter at that point.  The mentality of a typical potential customer --after massive investments in educating them-- is now very different.  Now customers look at the available products and think about which one to buy rather than whether or not to take a risk with this new technology.  That&#x27;s a massively different mind-set.  That&#x27;s a mind set primed for well executed product, marketing and sales strategies with wide distribution, solid sales channels and a solid post-sales support infrastructure --all of which the established players either know how to do or already have in place.<p>Manufacturers entering the market after the education phase can focus on pricing, marketing and, in general, execution rather than educating or evangelizing the audience.  There&#x27;s a huge difference in cost of sales in &quot;nicely paved markets&quot;.<p>When that happens, when the market is &quot;flat&quot; and competitors enter in force, they could run right over Tesla, push them right off the edge of the market or they could be swallowed-up by a larger organization.  Let&#x27;s not forget Tesla sold somewhere in the order of twenty thousand cars --total.  There are companies that probably sell that many cars per day.  The difference in scale is huge.<p>It is possible that Tesla is at the start of an existential threat.  It is hard to predict which way this will go.  It&#x27;s all on them now and they are all-in.  They can&#x27;t afford many more fires.  And they certainly can&#x27;t afford to have the market turn on them.  They need to be way ahead of this and spend lots of money to show people this technology is safe.  And, if it isn&#x27;t, they need to move quickly to make it safe and then show the market.  Quickly.<p>Volvo used to run commercials featuring cars being rolled and crashed in order to show how well they protected occupants.  Tesla might have to crash a few cars into concrete walls or into each other to demonstrate how survivable their high voltage and high current systems might be.  If they don&#x27;t get ahead of this and more accidents are reported the cost to regain market trust will grow exponentially.  And that could be very difficult to survive."

I remember speaking with a 60+ year old homeless woman in NYC once who told me she refused to go to the shelter because it was filled with crazy people. Also you have to check out of the shelter every day, and if you don&#x27;t check back in by a certain time, then they can&#x27;t let you in. It shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that many would prefer to sleep on the streets than deal with that.<p>&gt;  Best solution so far is a social one where people help them find a new sense of achievement and a place in society.<p>This is why I&#x27;m a proponent of a jobs guarantee.

"A similarly curious case is Moldova, Romania&#x27;s neighbour.<p>I grew up there, I remember dial up and wasting a lot of my mother&#x27;s money on it. Then the state run ISP rolled out ADSL and it got way better. In the span of 2-3 years, I went from 64&#x2F;64 kbit&#x2F;s to 6&#x2F;1 Mbps.<p>In another year, it was 24&#x2F;1 Mbps, and yet another year or so they started rolling out fiber, with free upgrades for everyone as long as you renewed the contract. 30&#x2F;30 Mbps, then 100&#x2F;100 Mbps, now you can get 1000&#x2F;1000 for $20 or 300&#x2F;300 Mbps for $10. Upgrading to a higher speed is still free afaik, but your contract gets renewed for 3 years.<p>Interestingly, it used to be possible to get multiple connections at the same house (like, literally, multiple fiber cables). Not sure if that&#x27;s still possible and what the limit was per individual&#x2F;house, but I always wondered if one could get something ridiculous like 4000&#x2F;4000 Mbps aggregate speed.<p>And yes, the upload speeds are true, although their own routers won&#x27;t reach them.<p>But good news, you can use any router with an SFP transceiver.<p>I am not aware of anything like the private networks created in Romania by individuals. There are a few other ISPs that started early, and technically competed with Moldtelecom (the state run ISP) with their own cables, but they did not operate outside the capital for a very long time. Moldtelecom had a monopoly.<p>There used to be a lot of Internet cafes that everyone would use for LAN gaming and Internet browsing, it was fun.<p>This might be the best thing the government has done in the country since independence, I don&#x27;t know what motivations they had, they didn&#x27;t seem to be lobbied by anyone since there were no Internet startups with significant influence. They just sort of... did it.<p>If anyone knows more about the history of Internet in the Republic of Moldova, please comment.<p>Now there&#x27;s talks of selling Moldtelecom to Huawei, which might be a bad idea.

"As an interesting side note, ham radio operators heavily use a digital mode called PSK31.

PSK31 does not transmit 8 bit bytes, but instead uses what they call a Varicode, a kind of Fibonacci code. More frequent characters are encoded using fewer bits, thus the encoded bit rate is an approximation of the entropy in the text stream."

"My understanding is that &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom is perfectly fine for almost all cases, including session keys and such but (if only for the sake of paranoia) for long lived keys it is worth the potential extra time waiting for &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random to serve what you need.<p>The key to remember is that when the pool has sufficient entropy there is no difference between &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random and &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom, and if the pool is low then there is <i>practically</i> no difference between &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random and &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom - the quality of the PRNG means it is practically impossible to tell the difference between the two outputs (take a few thousand bits from each at a time and see if any statistical analysis can reliably tell the difference).<p>It is increasingly common for CPUs and&#x2F;or related chipsets to have a built in TRNG so keeping the entropy pool &quot;topped up&quot; is getting easier by feeding the pool from those using rng-tools.

"Hey Mark. The overview seem to be much of the same. There&#x27;s a lot of excited talk, which is fine, but should be limited to a leading paragraph. The fundamental issue is performance in face of transactions that need to do 2PC among multiple nodes (which also need to sync with the replicas).<p>I&#x27;m not much of an expert at all, but I like reading papers on databases. It seems to me that if you really did discover a breakthrough like this, you should be able to distill it to some basic algorithms and math. And a breakthrough of this scale would be quite notable.<p>If I&#x27;m reading correctly, there&#x27;s no replica code even involved ATM. So 500Ktx&#x2F;s really boils down to ~83Ktx&#x2F;sec per node, on an in-memory database. Is it possible on modern hardware that this is just what to expect?<p>I am curious, and I&#x27;m not trying to be dismissive, but the copy sounds overly promising, without explaining how, even in theory, this will actually work.

- routing
- useful abstractions like decoupling services from host processes
- propogating security contexts through the chains of service calls that can develop when these systems evolve
- strong typing, which enabled layers of tooling to replace manually doing jobs with these systems and various advanced features.<p>That was called SOA, because it looks at software architecture as a set of services.<p>Then along came a bunch of programmers that weren&#x27;t very studious, started from scratch just doing basic message passing without all the advanced features that had been built up by the decades of previous hard won lessons.

The ScyllaDB one is a bit funny anyway as it doesn&#x27;t really target analytical workloads. On SSE&#x2F;GPUs - the ClickHouse guys don&#x27;t use GPUs today (GPUs are on the roadmap for next year) as their workloads target volumes greater than GPU memory. If your hot dataset sits totally in GPU memory then it makes sense for some things otherwise they found the cost&#x2F;performance ratio doesn&#x27;t add up after you paginate in&#x2F;out. I don&#x27;t doubt GPU based DB perf numbers but cost is the main factor.<p>Now just to clarify - you&#x27;re saying Scylla writes are 100x faster on the same hardware as ClickHouse (so 800M row&#x2F;s on a NUC). Using the same code that Altinity used I manage around 25M rows&#x2F;s on my home PC (8 cores&#x2F;16HT) and elsewhere in this thread the guys from VictoriaMetrics pulled in 53M rows&#x2F;s on a single node with 28 cores&#x2F;56 threads (probably doable with ClickHouse on similar hardware I&#x27;d suspect).<p>I&#x27;m going to test this with Scylla on my home PC to validate your 800M row&#x2F;s claim and I&#x27;ll post about it - I should be able to hit around 2.5 billion rows&#x2F;s with Scylla if what you&#x27;ve said is true.

Consumers&#x27;s primary demands are things like better battery life, price, and smaller form factors so it makes sense to go with 1Gbit. Additionally, a lot of the most popular computers today don&#x27;t even include a real Ethernet port; it&#x27;s a folding mechanism which saves space but would make a 10Gbit spec Ethernet port (shielding, etc.) even more of a challenge.<p>Modern chipsets are starting to include 2.5&#x2F;5Gbit chipsets which benefit from higher speeds but are still much cheaper than 10Gbit. I think a lot of players in this space were expecting and waiting for 10Gbit to become much cheaper and efficient but that did not happen.<p>Many Ultrabooks drop the Ethernet port altogether forcing the use of USB-C adapters. USB-C&#x2F;thunderbolt has a theoretical bandwidth of 20&#x2F;40Gbit&#x2F;s which means you, in theory, could buy a 10Gbit ethernet to thunderbolt adapter.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more on the technical side that has kept the price&#x2F;energy of 10Gbit high but I don&#x27;t know the details."
"Depends on the box, but some years ago, I picked up an old slotted-Xeon server at a swap for a few bucks, and it had 32 DIMM slots on an enormous memory sub-board. Took registered or buffered ECC, as I recall. I scored a few modules on eBay and put 256MB into it, I think it would&#x27;ve gone to 4GB if I filled all the slots.<p>But the hard drives were SCSI SCA-2, which I believe maxed out at 40MB&#x2F;s but in practice the drives were much slower. So yes, there was probably a point in time where a reasonably-beefy box would have had the specs you describe."

"There are multiple levels of compression.<p>What typically happens here in the USA is that your local TV station gets, via satellite, a &quot;master feed&quot; which typically is very high bitrate Mpeg4.<p>It then converts it to Mpeg2 (which requires a higher bitrate for the same quality), and compresses it to fit into its 19Mb&#x2F;s ATSC 8VSB broadcast standard.  If your local broadcaster has no subchannels, then you win(1).  The network show gets all 19Mb&#x2F;s of bandwidth.<p>However, if your local station has many subchannels (eg, 24hr weather, local news, re-runs of shows from the 1950s, etc), then they all share that 19 Mb&#x2F;sec and you get far less than 19Mb&#x2F;s allocated to the network show (especially when there is a lot of motion on the subchannel).   The worst I&#x27;ve seen is some ABC affiliates who actually had a <i>SECOND</i> &quot;HD&quot; subchannel for the &quot;livewell&quot; network, which made their network programming look horrible.   I put up a bigger antenna to pull in ABC from a neighboring market &amp; avoid a local affiliate that was doing that.<p>Your local cable company picks up the MPEG2 broadcast and if you&#x27;re lucky, it just passes it through (re-muxing it into a 38Mb&#x2F;s QAM subchannel).   If you&#x27;re unlucky, it takes the already compressed MPEG2 stream and compresses it harder.<p>Back in the &quot;good old days&quot;, the network satellite feeds were not encrypted, and people with the right equipment (Big Ugly Dishes) could pick up the raw network feed, which was reportedly awesome.<p>(1) That is, you win if the equipment doing the MPEG4 -&gt; MPEG2 transcoding doesn&#x27;t suck.   I&#x27;ve consistently seen stations that have a lower bitrate but better quality due to newer encoders doing things like adding repeat field flags to telecined film content, so your mileage may vary."

"I know the first thing that shocked me was how they could get so close to something that was purpose built for time series. Even being within spitting distance is really great in my opinion for an off the shelf, general tool.<p>&gt; However none of the databases tested above is anywhere close to the efficiency of a column store database that can do vectorized execution over batches of rows. ClickHouse is a good example of one such database. For queries that have to shift through large amounts of data, either filtering or aggregating it, the performance difference is easily &gt;10x. I was seeing aggregation performance above 2B rows&#x2F;s and that was I&#x2F;O throughput bound.<p>Agreed -- OLTP (in the case of Timescale) and purpose built timeseries-focused (but not necessarily analytics focused) DBs hold nothing to a proper OLAP database.<p>Did you write about this anywhere? would love to read it.

The majority of silicon on a chip is dedicated to masking the extremely high latency (50-100 processor cycles) and constrained bandwidth of DRAM (8GB&#x2F;s vs 1TB&#x2F;s with state of the art GPUs). Adding more cores is complicated by the fact that you need to synchronise all those caches. Out of order execution also has a relatively high fixed power consumption which is why modern x86 have a worse performance&#x2F;watt ratio than ARM processors which only introduced out of order capability in newer designs like the A9 which is the primary reason why the iPad Pro approaches x86 performance.<p>There are only a few solutions for this problem. Fast optical interconnects are needed or the DRAM has to be on the same package as the CPU.

"IF drones are more effective at killing the enemy than earlier methods (tomahawk missile from sea, manned airplane&#x2F;s releasing multiple missiles) where effective = = smaller, more targeted kills then they are reducing the horror of the war on the enemy too. That would be on a micro level and it appears to be true. If however as a result of the ease of using drones you run significantly more attacks than pre drones the net effect would be more horrors visited on the overall population. These are very real questions worth answering. We&#x27;d all love for there not to be wars but if there are then prosecuting them in the most humane way possible to target only the combatants is a very worthwhile thing to study. I&#x27;d like to learn more. I also agree with your point that if we become so effective at this to the point where the enemy feels no chance at any type of revenge because they never even get to engage with a real live American then out of frustration they very well might turn to more terrorist acts.

"&gt; why airplanes have to dump fuel when emergency&#x2F;unplanned (e.g. due to medical emergency) landing<p>Though perhaps that&#x27;s not the best example - for a really urgent medical emergency where every minute matters, an overweight landing would certainly be considered ahead of wasting precious time dumping fuel. Equally, there are a few more other types of emergencies where you&#x27;d want to get back onto the ground ASAP even if that means exceeding the maximum landing weight.<p>&gt; While the passengers may survive a full weight landing, the plane will incur heavy damage.<p>At least these days, all aircraft certified under Part 25 must be able to land at maximum take-off weight with a descent rate of 6 ft&#x2F;s (360 ft&#x2F;min), which is already at the border towards what would be considered a hard landing (at maximum landing weight, planes need to allow a landing with 10 ft&#x2F;s &#x2F; 600 ft&#x2F;min without structural damage).<p>So of course you still need to consider whether the changed performance characteristics (approach speed, required runway length, climb gradient for go-arounds, etc.) at MTOW will still allow you to land safely in that specific situation, but fear of &quot;heavy damage&quot; is <i>not</i> something you need to consider.
You might want to bring the plane down a little even more careful than usual, the brakes certainly have to work harder and maybe the plane needs to be inspected afterwards just to be sure, but otherwise you should be fine."

"There needs to be a new unit that describes &quot;a speed equal to the fastest humans have been able to travel in space&quot; instead of &quot;light years&quot;. Let&#x27;s call it an &quot;Apollo&quot;, since that record is held by the Apollo missions to the moon at 11,080 m&#x2F;s. Speed of light is 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s. So humans can travel at ~0.0000367 x light speed, or 349,418,880,000 m&#x2F;year.<p>So instead of saying 40 light years, we&#x27;d say 27,076 Apollo years."

"Actually for the case it was on SSD. Most of the access is to compressed columnar data. The main table had 500+ columns of ~140m rows but with very low entropy (e.g. gender, city&#x2F;district). Each column had its own file. And queries were relatively simple. At 300MB&#x2F;s (at the time) it was pretty fast. Data was mmap since as in most real life scenarios, the access to the columns had a power law distribution. Most queries could resolve with RAM data (~24GB&#x2F;s at the time). Data size was over 10x the size of RAM (~128GB). IO is fast if you do mostly sequential access. Note server NVMe today is ~8x faster so the principle still applies.<p>The main thing here is the simplicity of the architecture and combining HyPer, careful mmap usage, and having SQLite engine do all the other non-critical work. So this way this system could be implemented on time by 1 main developer (rockstar dev, Marcelo) and a tiny little help from me.<p>(Actual author of the idea&#x2F;architecture here, not mentioned on the paper, but that&#x27;s life, haha)"

"<i>&gt; Say it eats an atom - it has to accelerate that atom to the same relativistic velocity</i><p>Not quite the same, but almost, yes. The final velocity of the hole after it eats the atom will be equal to the velocity of the center of mass of the hole + atom before the atom is eaten. But if the hole has the rest mass of Mount Everest, the motion of the center of mass of the system will be almost the same as the motion of the hole, since the rest mass of Mount Everest is probably about 40 orders of magnitude larger than the rest mass of an atom.<p><i>&gt; meaning that new atom now has EXACTLY the same gamma as the black hole</i><p>Yes. But this gamma will be slightly less than the gamma of the hole before it ate the atom.<p><i>&gt; and steals just as much momentum as if gamma was 1.</i><p>I see what you&#x27;re thinking, but it&#x27;s still wrong; you haven&#x27;t calculated the effect correctly. See below.<p><i>&gt; It only needs to absorb mass similar to its own rest mass.</i><p>No. Say the hole starts out with rest mass M, and is moving at velocity v, where v is almost 1 (the speed of light), so the gamma factor is, say, 1000. Then the total momentum is about 1000M.<p>Now the hole absorbs enough atoms to have rest mass 2M, and each atom is at rest before it&#x27;s absorbed, so each atom contributes zero momentum to the total, so the total momentum is still 1000M after all the atoms are absorbed. That means the gamma factor is now (to a very good approximation) 500 (rest mass 2M times gamma of 500 times v approximately 1 gives momentum 1000M), which still corresponds to an ultrarelativistic velocity.<p>For the velocity to be less than Earth escape velocity, the total momentum of 1000M would have to be carried by a hole with a rest mass of about 3 million M, since Earth escape velocity is about 1&#x2F;3000 of the speed of light (11.2 km&#x2F;s vs. 300,000 km&#x2F;s)--i.e., we would have rest mass 3 million M times gamma of approximately 1 times v of 1&#x2F;3000, to give total momentum 1000M.<p><i>&gt; That is also irrelevant. The only thing that matters is its &quot;width&quot;, i.e. how many of the particles it interacts with does it eat.</i><p>The cross section (what you are calling &quot;width&quot;--what fraction of particles encountered does the hole eat) will depend on the speed of the hole; the faster the hole is traveling, the lower the cross section will be."

"I have not heard about a west coast launch pad, but I was wondering how they planned to actually accomplish the landing.

You’re overpaying by 50x if you pay for a server. At a small scale this difference is huge, as you grow it converges though.<p>But really, most application developers don’t care, and don’t want to care, about the underlying servers. Figuring out how autoscaling works, or keeping the kernel up to date. Individually none of these things are that hard, but there’s a bunch of time that adds up.  Time that could be spent adding features that make money.<p>There is still a lot of marketing hype around it. Things like infinitely scalable fall apart when you have connection limits on a db and lambda doesn’t support pooling. Aws pushes it because it gives them extra flexibility - doubling the density of functions is probably easier than instances.<p>I don’t think the current form of api gateway + lambda is the final state, but something more like fargate, where you get a whole container and no time limit, is really interesting.

Each generation also multiplying the power needed by some amount as well). And that kind of buying, manufacturing, and power generation isn&#x27;t going to be easy to conceal.<p>Not to mention that evidence of a 50% attack will basically end bitcoin, making all of the money, time, and power spent on that attack truly worthless as you are left with a million completely worthless SHA256 hashing machines.<p>If you are able to pull off that kind of hashrate, you might as well just be a good player at that point, as you would be making $50,000 every 10 minutes at current prices."

"<i>If you assume roughly even distributions of talent across gender</i><p>Given the differences in the genders of who chooses to study the relevant qualifications, that&#x27;s obviously a false assumption.<p><i>The amount of just unsourced vitriol of your comment is unapproachable</i><p>My comments are phrased in a level, factual manner. They&#x27;re mostly retellings of things seen or experienced first hand, thus I am myself the source. But if you want sourced evidence of similar claims, by all means, go read the recruiter lawsuit against Google that was filed. It has plenty.<p><i>Maybe try talking to actual women in the field before making such wildly false claims</i><p>If you&#x27;re going to assert a claim is false you need to pick something specific and show it&#x27;s false, otherwise you&#x27;re just blustering. And having direct experience of talking to women about this, I can tell you that many recognise the built-in advantage they have and are quite uncomfortable about it.<p><i>I do find it hilarious that there&#x27;s this overarching &quot;feminist propaganda&quot; and despite all that tech companies still routinely have essentially no women in the engineering staff.

As for &quot;essentially no women&quot; you mean about 15-20%, which is far cry from essentially none. It&#x27;s this sort of thing that justifies my claim of propaganda; it&#x27;s normal for jobs to have unbalanced distributions of genders. Very few jobs have exactly equal proportions of men and women.

So, not bad at all, but don&#x27;t expect those speeds everywhere.<p>On a side note, my current ISP just started rolling out 10Gb&#x2F;s here. The geek in me really wants to get it, but I&#x27;m having a real hard time even making up excuses for the added cost, around $700, compared to $40 for gigabit."
"Hi there, didn&#x27;t see this until just now.<p>The metric that is improving is the latency experienced by a user.<p>Imagine that you have a web app that takes one second of server CPU time to render a page, and you have three servers which process three hits a second in total. All three servers are thus on 100% CPU load, dealing with one hit a second each.<p>Each time somebody visits your site, they are going to experience a 1 second latency (in addition to communication latency), as they wait for one of your servers to build the page.<p>If you then optimize your code so that it completes in a third the time, 333ms, then your servers are going to suddenly be at 1&#x2F;3 load; they execute their one query for 333ms, and then sleep for 667ms.<p>Not just that; but the user now only has to wait for 333ms for the page to render on the server, so the site gets a lot more snappy for them.<p>Then you can shut down two servers leaving one; it will sit on 100% load, but you <i>still keep</i> the shorter 333ms latency experienced by your users.<p>You are doing the same amount of work as before - 3 hits a second. But previously, when the tasks took 1s each, three would be running in parallel, each being completed more slowly. With the faster run time, they are running in series, being completed quickly before switching to the next one.<p>Now, this does <i>not</i> apply if your requests are queuing. Because you&#x27;re not able to do any more work than before (after shutting down the other two servers), if your hits&#x2F;s exceeds the capacity of your servers to deal with them, the backlog will grow just as fast as it normally would have, and the latency caused by this will sky rocket.<p>Your example doesn&#x27;t fit because multiple machines aren&#x27;t ever used to process front end web requests in parallel; you don&#x27;t render half of a template on one machine, and the other half on another, for example. If you can set up a system like this and see gains from it, then what I&#x27;ve written above will not apply."
"There&#x27;s also IOPS for random 4k block access, which is usually way below 25MB&#x2F;s. Typically around 2000&#x2F;500 r&#x2F;w IOPS for regular A1 cards. With expensive cards you can get to 2500-3000 range.<p>Read queries will be cached in RAM and fast (for &lt;1GB database), and write queries will be limited to 500 IOPS, and heavily dependent on how you use transactions and write queries in your database.<p>Also disabling statistics collecting is the first thing I do when putting a postgresql db on an sd card.

These 2 things are created in different semiconductor technology (materials) that have quite different properties.   Most communications are either in GaAs for NIR or in InGaAS&#x2F;InP for mid IR.  Visible stuff here is generally a large GaN die pumping a phosphor material.   As the size of the die increases so does its capacitance which ultimately limits the rate at which the signal can be modulated or the brightness of the source.  Additionally in the visible you use Si detectors which are slow due also to their large capacitance.   So I think it&#x27;s unlikely you could ever realize 224Gb&#x2F;s unless you were using WDM (wavelength multiplexing).

"&gt;The momentum change over the distance of 2 inches produces a force of about 360,000 Newton<p>you&#x27;re right that the force will be huge, and you&#x27;re dead wrong about the force effect.<p>lets say we stop the bullet over the distance of 1cm instead of 2 inches - the stopping force to act upon bullet would be even bigger - 1.8M Newtons (30 elephants!). The same value force will be acting upon our 5lb armor plate. This force will be acting until the bullet stops, ie. for about 0.02 milliseconds. During that time the force would accelerate the armor plate to the speed of 16m&#x2F;s and the armor plate would travel less than 1mm - only starting to compress the padding under the armor plate. So, 0.02 milliseconds after the bullet impact we have a stopped bullet and the armor plate moving with the speed of 16m&#x2F;s through the first millimeter of the padding - the situation is no different than being hit by a frying pan."

"On of the serious drawbacks of Netmap is that it amortizes, but does not mitigate system call latencies. This means that although it can handle high packet rates, latencies for processing are dominated by the system call overhead (typically about 5us). This may not sound like much, but on a 10Gb&#x2F;s network (1 bit = 0.1ns), 5us = 50,000bits or roughly 5KB. For small packets, this means that you have to batch very aggressively (about 150 packets at a time) in order to keep up."

"10 GbE or M.2 NVMe performance is already significantly degraded by being on a PCH in the first place.  More hops, higher latency, much lower IOPS.  Don&#x27;t do it if you can avoid it.<p>The thing is that most things aren&#x27;t (currently) bottlenecked by PCIe 3.0.  A 2080 Ti shows about 3% performance degradation by running in 3.0x8 mode.  4 lanes of PCIe 3.0 is 4 GB&#x2F;s (32 Gb&#x2F;s) which is plenty for 10 Gb&#x2F;s networking... or even 40 Gb&#x2F;s networking like Infiniband QDR (which runs at 32 Gb&#x2F;s real speed after encoding overhead).  So you can reasonably run graphics, 10 GbE, and one NVMe device off your 3.0x16 PEG lanes.<p>And AMD also provides an extra 3.0x4 for NVMe devices, so you can run graphics, 10 GbE, <i>and</i> NVMe RAID without touching the PCH at all.<p>The real use-case that I see is SuperCarrier-style motherboards that have PEX&#x2F;PLX switches and shitloads of x16 slots multiplexed into a few fast physical lanes, like a 7-slot board or something.  Or NVMe RAID&#x2F;JBOD cards that put 4 NVMe drives onto a single slot.  But right now there are no PEX&#x2F;PLX switch chips that run at PCIe 4.0 speeds anyway, so you can&#x27;t do that."

"Converting everything to metric and working out the centripetal acceleration, a radius of 1 mile yields a centripetal acceleration of 232g, to an arbitrary 3 significant figures. A radius of 2 miles yields 116g. The acceleration would drop linearly along the length of the &quot;arm&quot; as you move toward the center, so you could calculate (with calculus, over which I can&#x27;t be bothered at the moment) the optimal way to taper the arm from root to tip for a given end load.<p>Drag losses <i>on the arm</i> at a 1 or 2 mile radius would dominate, and ridiculously so. Frankly, roughly 100-230g is not severe at all for a properly engineered vehicle at the payload ratio you could expect to achieve if you get the first 2.2 km&#x2F;sec &quot;free&quot;, as you would in this scheme. That&#x27;s the majority of a factor of exhaust velocity for a kerosene&#x2F;lox engine, and all of a factor of the exhaust velocity for a solid rocket motor. Multiples of exhaust velocities are factors of e, so you&#x27;re probably better than doubling the payload ratio. Perhaps counterintuitively, going from 3 percent mass fraction to 6 percent brings your vehicle size down by half. You go from ~33 times the payload to ~16 times the payload. And, while others are talking a good game about drag, this saves you loads in gravity losses, as the rocket is spending far less time fighting gravity with this initial boost. (1g for two minutes is 1.2 km&#x2F;s, give or take centripetal effects from your curved launch trajectory. Not negligible, at all.) The other commenters seem also to be <i>mostly</i> neglecting that the motor&#x2F;engine will very quickly reach near-vacuum conditions, not immodestly increasing its ISP.<p>Much better than a mile-long tether would be, in my not-so-humble initial opinion, to reduce the tether length by a factor of 10 or 100 from &quot;a mile&quot;, to give a centripetal g load of 2k-20k g. Again, calculus tells you how to taper your (probably carbon fiber, possibly consumable, most definitely streamlined) attachment rod. And don&#x27;t bother with the complexity of a vacuum. The Nike program launched vehicles at Mach 10 in the lower atmosphere. That&#x27;s 3.4 km&#x2F;s, 1.2 km&#x2F;s faster than SpinLaunch&#x27;s proposal. Given that heating goes something like the 4th power of velocity, Mach 6 or so is going to be much, much less severe than the Mach 10 environment encountered by Nike. Why, SpinLaunch vehicles won&#x27;t even get to glow white hot!"

But then what is a second? It&#x27;s 1&#x2F;60 of a minute which is 1&#x2F;60 of an hour which is 1&#x2F;24 of a day(and so it goes) and all those numbers are arbitrary. A day doesn&#x27;t make any sense outside our planet anyway, I doubt that there is another celestial body in the universe that takes the same time to complete a rotation. Period of some  natural phenomena (like atomic electron transition) sounds better as a unit but it&#x27;s a really tiny period of time so we have to scale it to make it practical for us. We will use decimal numeral system to do that, another arbitrary choice. What if we had 12 fingers or 8? This can be extended to all kinds of measurements so I wonder if any of this would make sense to another civilization. What would a cosmic system of units would like? Any reading about this would be greatly appreciated."

Whether you can get a bucket wheel trench excavator through it at speed or have to dig by hand depends on what&#x27;s in the ground and how hard the ground is, and how long the stretches are.<p>Otherwise, it&#x27;s like 10~20min to sufficiently properly terminate the fiber at the ends and that. You can likely get around that if you just order pre-terminated fiber at like 1$&#x2F;plug and just plug it in at the ends instead of splicing. Sure, this will higher losses, but money.<p>Fiber is literally cheaper than copper for &gt;150m or &gt;=10Gbit&#x2F;s (though direct-attach cables up to 3~5m are even cheaper) if you can get by without field-terminating fibers."

"It&#x27;s not near the bottom either which is the point. Actually Phoenix (the only Erlang base web framework I could find at the link) edges out quite a number of other frameworks, roughly ranking in the middle of the pack. Specifically Phoenix performed 32k req&#x2F;s, in comparison to say the Go based Gin which does 51k req&#x2F;s or a arguably more comparable setup of,Python3 Flask with full ORM at 13k. Spring only manages in 23k req&#x2F;s. Nothing to write home about either way but clearly along the lines of my argument that Erlang&#x2F;Beam can hold its own. Though some of the ruby frameworks are damn impressive seaming, huh.<p>However it gets more interesting if you look at the Latency tab. There Phoenix comes in with an average of 7.9 ms. In comparison Gin averages 5.8 ms, Spring at 12.1 ms, Flask Py3 at 23.1 or Py2 at 14.7 ms.<p>Where it&#x27;s really interesting is looking at the max latency. Presuming this indicates roughly how 99th and 95th percentiles measurements would compare. In this category Phoenix comes in second with a max of 22.0 ms, behind only lib-mongodb at 20.8 ms. The lib-Mongolia is one of the fastest frameworks by raw req&#x2F;s.<p>Appreciate the link to the benchmarks! Much more interesting, especially if you&#x27;re concerned about max latency (and likely 99&#x2F;95 th percentiles). In this case BEAM&#x2F;Phoenix would let you plan capacity to minimize max latency fairly well as it appears very consistent."

"When we did intensity modulation, there was a time when some cables, particularly in Japan used NZDSF (Non Zero dispersion shifted fiber) type fiber.   This was useful when we used OOK (on-off keying) and direct detection.  With direct detection, we didn’t have access to the phase and could not compensate for dispersion all that well.  So we used a DSF (dispersion shifted fiber) that has the opposite slope (sign) and cancels out the dispersion.   This was imperfect and DSF was a source of nonlinearity due to its narrower core (nonlinearity goes as the time derivative of the intensity per unit area).<p>There is no perfect amount of dispersion.  However allowing the dispersion to increase in modern cables also allows us to make the fiber core a little bigger.  This reduces the intensity per unit area, reducing the fiber nonlinearity.  Additionally there’s some benefit for highly dispersed signals as they look like noise.<p>For long distances we encode the information on the electric field phase and amplitude as us done in wireless. In actuality most of what’s done in optical from a modulation point of view and most of the theory comes from wireless originally.  A difference is that we use a laser as a local oscillator to shift the data back down to baseband just like in wireless.  We did intensity modulation for a long time because the signal speeds are very high and the semiconductor technology wasn’t there to do ADC and DACs at the rates we needed at low enough power and cost.  This changed around 2008 when the first coherent systems became practical due to the availability of 45nm CMOS.<p>Now most everything above 25Gb&#x2F;s and 80km is coherent.  Below that we still do intensity modulation and inside data centers it’s all intensity modulation.  This is due to cost and power reasons.  Even in 7nm, coherent is still higher power on a bit&#x2F;s basis.  It’s also more expensive due to complexity of the transmitter and receiver as well as the need for better quality lasers."
"&gt; And IIRC, the diffuser is quite fast<p>Kinda. When Elephant was designed AES-NI did not exist, and so AES was expected to work at somewhere between 10-20 cycles per byte. Elephant worked somewhere between 5-10 cpb, so it was not a lot of overhead. Post-AES-NI, however, the majority of CPU time is now spent on the diffuser.<p>Furthermore, SSDs were not popular at the time this was designed. So the relative low speed of software AES + diffuser was not that big a deal. Now, with 500 MB&#x2F;s and higher drives, cipher speed matters. For reference, 10 cpb translates to ~200 MB&#x2F;s in your average 2 GHz processor.<p>This is not to say that removing Elephant was a good idea, but the performance argument is not entirely unreasonable. It is of course possible to design a new diffuser that can take better advantage of modern chips; maybe they should do that."

"PHP is a joke, you can&#x27;t seriously ask that question in 2014 &quot;why not PHP?&quot;. There are 100000s websites about why it is a bad choice beside performance and security, you can easily look that up.<p>Why not Ruby&#x2F;Python though?<p>I think about these languages as developing something quick, a prototype, demo sort of things and internal tools for limited number of users (&lt;100 000). The performance is good enough for this range, and Sinatra&#x2F;Django gives you great tooling around building a small web application (regardless if it is a UI or just an API). The memory management of these languages (especially the libraries) are not great, so sooner or later you gonna hit a barrier (just like several companies did, Opscode, Twitter etc.) That is the time when you need to think about something else, or the TCO will consume your revenue and it is simply not profitable to run your service.<p>I am kind of surprised that you see Java at the top and nothing else. My experience is that Java, Erlang (and more recently probably Go) sits at the top, when you are talking about programming languages for implementing a web application.<p>But why?<p>Java as a language does not really matter much, same goes to Erlang and Go as well. The more important part is the VM and the libraries you need to use for building a webapp. JVM has outstanding single node performance, with libraries like Jetty (last time I measured it was doing 7500 req&#x2F;s with ~30ms p99 latency on my MBP out of the box) that gives you a great toolkit to implement a web application with amazing performance. Almost the same with Erlang, I think it still needs more community and better libraries, especially for more UI heavy apps, but on the other hand, the p100 latency is equal to p99 and p50 because of the per &quot;process&quot; (Erlang process, not operating system one) garbage collection. There is no global VM lock.<p>So, to answer your question, when Java? When you need good single node performance, you are expecting 1M+ users and you need to scale up your application with reasonable TCO. If you are more adventurous you can play with Erlang (build the next WhatsApp) or Go (and get the great support from the community and nice libraries from Google).<p>Personally I am using Compojure a lot with Jetty, and learning React (actually the Clojure port of it called Om). This gives me a sweet spot in terms of maturity, quick prototyping, lots of immutability and access to the most comprehensive library collection of the planet (LDAP, JDBC, you name it). I usually host my own stuff on AWS and company stuff is  hosted in our DCs."

"Going directly from low orbit to a transfer orbit to the second body will usually save some delta-V over going to escape orbit first and then going to transfer orbit.  I didn&#x27;t have the numbers for low lunar orbit to Mars transfer orbit, so I changed the Earth to Mars path for a fairer comparison.<p>I didn&#x27;t forget the Lagrange libration points, but decided not to include them because they were not relevant to the parent comment, and they would still require some mechanism to get propellant mass up to them.  They&#x27;re currently almost empty, and won&#x27;t be very useful until the Moon itself has launch capacity to get water up there.  Again, I was mainly responding to the parent post.<p>The rocket equation is indeed a bear.  As delta-V scales linearly, fuel requirements scale up exponentially.  One way to manage it is to use stages.  Another is to refuel and assemble vehicles higher up in the gravity well.  As it happens, shipping tanks of fuel and propellant up to LEO separately means that missions to Mars starting fully fueled from LEO would require only 0.9 km&#x2F;s more than missions starting from the lunar surface.  Measuring by delta-V, LEO is at about the halfway point for an Earth-Mars mission.<p>But it&#x27;s also worth noting that the surface of the Moon is closer to LEO than the surface of the Earth.  Shipping fuel and propellant from the Moon to LEO, to rendezvous with and refuel a vehicle coming up from Earth, is even cheaper than shipping up the resupply mass from Earth."

"Tent put in stupid spot on snow slope leading to it being hit by small avalanche in night, which slammed metal stove and wooden bunks into injured victims. Panicked, they cut open the tent from inside and ran from the slope, fearing another, worse avalance, taking injured people with them (leaving torch on tent in rush). Put the most injured in a small snow cave, wrapped her with their clothing, thinking they could go back for more and stay warm with a fire, but ran out of firewood (all small lower branches were broken from surrounding trees). Person&#x2F;s tried to go back to tent and died of cold on way, others died quickly afterwards (paradoxical undressing etc). Nothing weird happened at all. Probably too much alcohol, stupidity, dumb decisions and then panick. There is a full Russian coroners report online."

"The limitation isn&#x27;t the NIC, it&#x27;s the processor (and possibly storage). The 10 and 40 Gigabit NICs exist but processing them on a conventional PC is hard.<p>It is, just about, possible to perform actions on every packet in a 10Gb stream on an x86 machine. You have to use a userspace stack, handle packets across multiple cores, and be VERY careful with what you are doing so you don&#x27;t do cache misses. At 10Gb&#x2F;s you&#x27;re talking only a few hundred clock cycles per packet - anything that doesn&#x27;t work as planned causes massive backlog.<p>Now try serving (dynamic) HTTP to that."
"You can&#x27;t get close to 50 GB&#x2F;s of bandwidth to a single core, even if your memory configuration and controller supports that because the per core bandwidth is limited by the latency per cache line and the maximum number of concurrent requests. There is a maximum of 10 outstanding requests that missed in L1 per core, so if you take a (very good) latency to DRAM of 50 ns, you can reach only 64 bytes&#x2F;line * 10 lines outstanding &#x2F; 50 ns = 12.8 GB&#x2F;s.<p>In fact, you&#x27;ll observe pretty much exactly that limit if you disable hardware prefetching. Of course, almost no one does that, and it turns out in particular that one can do better than this limit due to hardware L2 prefetching (but not software, since it restricted by the same 10 LFBs as above), since the concurrency from L2 to the uncore and beyond is higher than 10 (perhaps 16-20) and the latency is lower, so you get higher concurrency, but you are still concurrency limited to around 30 GB&#x2F;s on modern Intel client cores.<p>On server cores, the latency is much higher, closer to 100ns, and so the per-core bandwidth is much lower, and the memory subsystem usually has a higher throughput, so it takes many more active server cores to saturate the memory bandwidth than on the client (which one just about does it on dual-channel systems)."

"Many years ago, when I used to play Minecraft, the common wisdom was simply to get as much memory as possible, so that the GC runs less frequently. With the debug overlay you could see how the game kept allocating at about a rate of 300-500 MB&#x2F;s until the JVM GC was triggered, which created a noticeable lag in the game. I used to know a few MC server admins, and I was surprised just how massive the resource consumption of the game was. One server I usually played on ran on multiple machines. Specs were I believe around 128 GB memory, 32 cores, 16 or so dedicated to GC..."

I usually have those, along with Photoshop and Parallels opened as well and haven&#x27;t felt any slowdown at all.<p>I&#x27;m using the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 800 and Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000, have a 23&quot; AOC monitor hooked up via Displayport to HDMI adapter from Monoprice.  This setup was probably around ~$1500 without any warranties.  I just picked up a nice SD card that is sized to fit almost flush with the Macbook Air and is 128 GB w&#x2F; a fast 90 MB&#x2F;s read&#x2F;write which I can use as  a file dump, that cost around $50 on Amazon, but worth picking up a few if you want to isolate projects or just use as backup.<p>Unfortunately, the Macbook family isn&#x27;t too upgrade friendly so you may buy a laptop and it may be underpowered and until you refresh your hardware, you&#x27;ll be stuck with that hardware, so it may take you a few years to get the exact setup you need.  This is why people recommend maxing out as much as you can with RAM and expand hard drive modularly.  I&#x27;d honestly recommend not going with an older model laptop or desktop because HD space is going to end up being your bottle neck, not RAM, and the newer lineups have USB 3.0 so you want to be sure you get that, then you can pick up a 1 TB external USB 3.0 HD for $100 and won&#x27;t suffer with USB 2.0 speeds."

"wat. The important figures for miners are the btc&#x2F;usd conversion rate, the network difficulty, your hash rate itself, how much you initially paid for your rig ($&#x2F;Gh) and how much power you&#x27;re drawing ($&#x2F;watt). All of these factors are important, but what will dominate over the coming months is power cost. Someone mining a 100 GH&#x2F;s rig will make 5 times less BTC per day as someone mining a 500 GH&#x2F;s rig, it&#x27;s true, but if the 500 GH&#x2F;s is sucking up proportionally more than 5 times the electricity then it can be better to mine with the lower hash rate. If the conversion rate improves that delays the period where electricity costs outweighs the income. For the difficulty to rise another order of magnitude (which would make BFL 60 GH&#x2F;s Singles worthless), there needs to be about another 30 PH added to the network -- where&#x27;s that coming from in only a month? In any case, people dropping their rigs because they&#x27;re too power hungry may cause the difficulty to go down and make it worthwhile again for some who live in low-electricity-cost areas... There are variables you&#x27;re not taking into account, hence the wat."

"The protocol is not the problem here.<p>Most commercial VPN products <i>are</i> IPsec internally, plus some proprietary authentication stuff.

See OpenConnect&#x27;s PulseSecure support for an example.)<p>Also, having both run a VPN for a large network, and worked on VPN software for large networks, once you get to high user counts it&#x27;s not as trivial as you think.<p>VPNs introduce extra latency, probably the corporate VPN hub is not at all on the shortest path to your actual destination. And corporate VPNs tend to go through (multiple) layers of other filtering. The bottleneck can be Pkts&#x2F;s, Byte&#x2F;s or Connections&#x2F;s and it is not at all obvious which it is. And so on.<p>Besides, there are reasons corporations pay for expensive VPN solutions - certifications and compliance driven requirements such as integration of endpoint management.<p>Not saying it can&#x27;t be done, but &quot;use IPsec or Wireguard&quot; misses the point entirely. (Of course, if those products were using Wireguard instead of IPsec, it would probably help a bit.)"

"Actually, I realized that we were both wrong on the math.<p>2200 gflop or 3500 gflop are the specs for just one of the Fire Pro cards. Whoops, I was writing a lot of comments that day.<p>So a Mac Pro with D700 GPUs has 7000 gflop&#x2F;s and runs $4600 (list), whereas the Tesla K80 has 8740 gflop&#x2F;s and runs $4900 or so. Since you still need a whole server to go with the K80, I stand by my thinking that it&#x27;s not a great deal.

"Reading this, I realized more than ever that while SATA is a good hardware standard, they messed up the naming. All throughout this post, mentions are made to &quot;SATA 3 throughput&quot;, which made me think they were referring to the one with 300 MB&#x2F;s transfers.

"Prehashing doesn&#x27;t just solve the storage issue. Imagine you want to sign a 1MB or even 1GB file with a typical hardware token. Without prehashing you&#x27;d have to send that entire 1MB or 1GB to the token, which has a throughput on the order of KB&#x2F;s or maybe MB&#x2F;s, and process all that data with a CPU clocked at MHz, not GHz. Breaking up the file into chunks doesn&#x27;t help, and might even make things slower, not to mention the added complexity introduced to your file signature format.<p>The obvious solution is to <i>hash</i> the data and sign the hash, just as is done for every other signature scheme. The downside is that now your signature scheme is only as strong as the hash. But if it turns out that SHA-512 isn&#x27;t collision resistant, you have much bigger problems.<p>PureEdDSA has its elegance, and, sure, use it if you can.

CPUs don’t benefit from wide, high latency access to large main memory as much as GPUs, due to the nature of SISD vs. SIMD.  Naturally, GPUs put more focus on a fatter pipe between the processor and main memory (GDDR and 500 GB&#x2F;s pipes).  CPUs operate on fewer data, so you can crank the speed of computation up if you crank the memory speed and keep latency low.

Because it front loaded all operations so that they happen outside of the benchmark.

The result of the query was calculated during insertion of the temperature record before the benchmark has even started and then they just calculated the theoretical number of queries you would have to do for an equivalent result and slapped that fictional number on their NUC.

"&gt; &quot;In contrast to cargo-only chemical space-gun concepts, a mass driver could be any length, affordable, and with relatively smooth acceleration throughout, optionally even lengthy enough to reach target velocity without excessive g forces for passengers.&quot;<p>Wikipedia can generally be pretty good, but the above text from the subsection <i>On Earth</i> shows what can go wrong when deluded space enthusiasts go nuts on an article; it&#x27;s pure wishful thinking. No major construction project of &quot;any length&quot; is &quot;affordable,&quot; especially not one of the sophistication of a mass driver. At about 3g, about 30 m&#x2F;s^2, it would take you about 270 seconds to get to 8 km&#x2F;second, during which time you are traveling at an average speed of 4 km&#x2F;second. This is a structure, with attendant control system and safeguards, about 1080 km, or 670 mi, in length. This is not affordable.

Skimming a couple km&#x2F;s off the high end of the rocket equation brings your mass ratio way down, especially considering the reduced gravitational losses. (I&#x27;m assuming, in a fit of witless optimism, that we&#x27;re launching from a high enough altitude that the increased aerodynamic losses are mitigated to the point that gravitational loss savings dominate, and that this adds no cost.)<p>Mass drivers are a fun idea because they <i>seem</i> to get around the rocket equation, but this affordability nonsense is just over the top."

"&gt; By contrast, fiber is symmetric, offering full capacities up and down at once.

"&gt; the biological signals attenuate with distance from source<p>The voltage signal is propagated in axons sometimes over very long distances (a meter, e.g. from the foot to the spine). It is renewed (see &quot;Nodes of Ranvier&quot;) along the path for as long as needed, at distances that depend on how, or if, the axon is myelinated. That&#x27;s why the speed is so slow (ca. 120 m&#x2F;s max., often much slower) - it&#x27;s actual ion movement through lots and lots of opening and closing voltage triggered channels all along the axons, compared to a purely electrical signal like in a metal wire. This means while in a wire the electrical field is from start to end, leading to electrons exiting on the far end pretty much instantaneously, in an axon am electrical field is only local, and only strong enough to trigger anything for about 1-2 millimeters at best. Then there have to be a new set of channels triggered by the electrical field further up the axon that renew the signal by letting in ions.<p>Attenuation is more important in dendrites and neuron bodies, spatial distance of simultaneously incoming action potentials (via connected axons from other neurons) plays a role in determining whether a threshold is reached that would trigger firing an action potential from this neuron. Since a dendritic arbor can be quite extensive and have lots of branches location - where exactly along the branches does an incoming signal attach - matters a lot."

"I live in a country with metric system. We use different units of measurement interchangeably because it&#x27;s easy to do so and we have gotten used to it. I am 1.74m or 174cm tall. The bus stop is 500m or half a kilometer away from my home, etc. While nobody converts 250km to meters, when the value is closer to one, both units of measurement are equally useful and equally used.<p>Also all physics and engineering formula are designed to get and return metric values. When I see K = 0.5<i>m</i>v^2, I know v is supposed to be m&#x2F;s and m is in kilograms and the result would be in Joules. If it&#x27;s E = m*c^2, the same thing could be inferred about it.<p>I&#x27;m curios with all different units of measurement, how do you know when to use which.

Don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s too expensive to manufacture and too hard to use. Copper cables are expensive and easily confused with the cheaper cables that don&#x27;t work.

"Mostly depressing. Basically the Telcos are acting in the same way as the ones in the USA. But we didn&#x27;t have such an uproar from the people without which, I assume, the new NN rules couldn&#x27;t be established in the USA.<p>Politicians are influenced mostly from the telcos and seem to follow their line of argument. We do have some services that would violate net neutrality rules, like the circumvention of data caps sold by Deutsche Telekom (totally different from T-Mobile US) for users of Spotify.<p>In addition there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much hope for the internet&#x27;s infrastructur. Germany has one of the world&#x27;s worst FTTH market penetration. It&#x27;s literally non-existent. Telcos try to use the old copper lines and cable to avoid investing and they seem quite succesful in convincing the government that fibre optics is not necessary.<p>The last frustration came from a government agenda a few months ago. It states that until 2018 everyone should have 50MBit&#x2F;s. But it doesn&#x27;t state by which means or whether this applies to the downlink or peak speed or whatever. Many people fear that the telcos will meet the goal by simply putting up some LTE towers with data caps and &quot;theoretical peak transfer rate&quot; of 50Mbit&#x2F;s.<p>The agenda&#x27;s goal would be met, since it&#x27;s formulated so vaguely. However, we are just postponing the necessary FTTH build-out, while the big telcos make stupidly high profits from infrastructure that has amortized decades ago.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue with peering. Up until recently Deutsche Telekom was basically non-existent at the DE-CIX (Germany&#x27;s largest Internet Exchange). Now they have a little band-width there. However, as Deutsche Telekom was once a state-owned company (still partially state-owned) and owns basically all copper infrastructur (ISPs can rent the last-mile), they are on a high horse and expect everyone to pay for peering, similar to Comcast.<p>So yeah, up until recently, Germany and the USA could have a shittiness contest when it comes to the inet. Now, the winner is more clear."

"Middleware doesn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t solve the distribution problem. The aggregation of content is a non-problem.<p>Video distribution is expensive and technically complicated.<p>Say I&#x27;ve got a video channel and most of my content is &quot;talking head&quot; style. Encoding 1080p using in a widely compatible h.264 configuration (Main profile level 3) I could easily get good quality output at a data rate between 1-2Mb&#x2F;s, let&#x27;s say 1.5Mb&#x2F;s. That&#x27;s about 11MB per minute of video for storage purposes (for that single config).<p>In order to serve those videos to streaming clients I&#x27;ll need 1.5Mb&#x2F;s of bandwidth for each client. Any lower of a transfer rate and the playback will stall. Faster data rates can allow for a larger buffer but the file&#x27;s data rate is your transfer minimum to actually play the content as it downloads.<p>So back to our video channel. Self hosting on my residential connection means I&#x27;m limited by my shitty upstream bandwidth and throttling from my ISP if not outright T&amp;C violations. My home connection I could serve maybe a half dozen clients simultaneously. So long as my content is unpopular that might be ok. Bubbling up on an aggregator or just making an interesting video would DDoS me and no one would get to see it. It I want to spend ~$60 a year on cloud hosting I could serve a lot more connections. Then I&#x27;m out $60 a year or more if I want to make a longer history of my content available, remember 11MB a minute.<p>If I want to have better compatibility and broader reach I would need to encode a couple more versions of my videos at the cost of storage and my time.<p>So self hosting either costs me money or severely limits the availability of my content. P2P distribution can <i>help</i> a little but it has its own issues. Even an aggregator offering paid hosting doesn&#x27;t really solve the issue because I&#x27;m still out some money. Were I to make any money from advertising or patronage that hosting cost would come right off the top.<p>The situation is even more difficult if you consider mobile access which is a huge portion of online video access. For a lot of reasons self hosting from mobile devices isn&#x27;t practical. P2P from a mobile device is likewise impractical. So for anyone with a mobile device as their primary computing device, a non-trivial number of people, they would have to pay for some third party hosting without a meaningful self hosting option.<p>Demand from mobile devices also significantly increases your need for multiple encodings of a video. Mobile streaming needs to respond to much more drastic traffic conditions than your laptop on your home WiFi. This increases storage requirements meaning less historic content or increased storage costs."

"Actually it&#x27;s super easy, barely an inconvenience, since the raw memory bandwidth you get per core is around 1 byte per cycle and half that per thread.

Meanwhile the CPU can actually achieve ALU throughputs that are 20 times greater than that. Even encryption algorithms are much faster than that.<p>The saving grace is not that there is a lot of memory bandwidth to go around; there isn&#x27;t; the saving grace is that a lot of processing either doesn&#x27;t use too much data (making caches effective) or is complex enough to not be limited by memory bandwidth. Rarely using all cores and threads at the same time helps a lot as well."

"Unless your data is at rest, you&#x27;re paying for bandwidth, not capacity. SRAM &gt; HBM &gt; DRAM &gt; NVMe when you&#x27;re buying bandwidth. Seriously, when we have a low-latency network, the most cost-effective way to run some simulations and graph algorithms is out of L3 on EPYC (where mid-tier parts have over 1 TB&#x2F;s at a fraction of the energy and cost of an A100&#x2F;MI100).<p>Your NVMe quotes 3.2 GB&#x2F;s, versus 25 GB&#x2F;s (theoretical) for a stick of DDR4-3200 (which is in the same price range). A standard 2-socket EPYC server can give you 300 GB&#x2F;s from DRAM, but you&#x27;d need several servers servers packed with NVMe to provide that bandwidth.<p>The rationale for persistent storage (like NVMe) as an algorithmic device is either (a) you need it to be persistent or (b) you have physical or algorithmic constraints that prevent you from using more parallelism and you&#x27;re willing to pay 5-10x for the privilege of executing from NVMe."

"Here&#x27;s the thing, this isn&#x27;t really just a PUB&#x2F;SUB queue. Their forex data example is disingenuous since it&#x27;s a bad application of their product. For comparison, our market data stream via ZeroMQ using UDP multicast gets around 20 million msg&#x2F;s (~15 gb&#x2F;s) with &lt;10 microseconds of latency. But we also buy very high end switches and NICs (that guarantee near-zero packet loss) with built-in redundancies. We use quorum and hardware fencing for fast failover. Even then our total network hardware cost is &lt; $20k for 8 nodes. Our stream aggregator&#x2F;producer and clients use fast serialization formats like flatbuffers that minimize dynamic memory allocations. JSON is suuuuper slow in comparison. We also use ring buffers designed to fit on a cache-line and bypass the kernel network stack (using DPDK). Fact is, if you&#x27;re just aggregating logs there&#x27;s no point in going through all this trouble. Nor will a cloud provider set up custom networking hardware just for you.<p>These high level messaging frameworks attempt to provide some degree of reliability and easy clustering out of the box while keeping things simple. For specific domains where performance is paramount, you can always find light-weight solutions that outperform them. For instance, with market data it&#x27;s almost always better to drop a quote if it&#x27;s out-of-sequence or got dropped somewhere than to add latency waiting for a retransmission. This simplifies things since you no longer need durability."

One hopes that the write speed of these disks will be proportionately faster than DVD write speed. A DVD writing at 16X transfers about 22MB&#x2F;s.

"I made the original proposal for will-change on Mozilla&#x27; behalf. I agree with your concerns, we&#x27;ve had them since 2010 and kept pushing back on proposing this. But with HiDPI mobile and 4k desktop it&#x27;s really difficult without it.<p>It is nearly impossible to predict changes that some page do in perfectly reasonable ways, especially for changes triggered from Javascript. It&#x27;s true that in some cases a will-change can be inferred from the style sheet but there are still too many changes triggered from JS events. You wont lose any performance by not using will-change and we will continue improving how we infer them. Once an element is declared as will-change the browser will be able to weight the hint and the platform specific costs of various possible optimization like layerizing the element and ignore it if it isn&#x27;t suitable for the device.<p>If we can&#x27;t predict the change then we&#x27;re left trying to be ready to change a new element within one vsync interval to avoid any latency. This is fine if you&#x27;re dealing with a small element but large elements like a fullscreen CSS page flip triggered from JS is going to be nearly impossible to perform without a frame or more of latency.<p>In the case of HiDPI mobile you typically have 2 millions pixels (8 MB) to deal with on a 1GB&#x2F;s memory bus with a frame time of 16ms. That means that if you touch 16 MB, or twice the size of the screen, then you have zero chance to perform that change without introducing delays. And this is without even considering the CPU&#x2F;GPU cost require to perform the change. The situation may also get tough on 4k desktop without a discrete GPU if you have 31MBs per fullscreen surface on a 10GB&#x2F;sec bus.<p>These are all theoretical throughput maximums. In practice on Android and Firefox OS where a style change occurs on large and complex elements where rasterization is difficult you can&#x27;t use SIMD to rasterize the page at memory bandwidth speeds, you instead are bottlenecked on rasterizing complicated content. It&#x27;s typical to see these complex change cause 100ms latency. Once the rasterization is made then the animations can continue smoothly but you&#x27;re still left with animations skipping at the beginning."

Having to carry a laptop everywhere is a real pain point which increases depending on where you live. Just because it isn&#x27;t a problem for you personally it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not a real problem that a lot of people face, even in the US. It&#x27;s hard to understand this if you&#x27;ve never lived in a dense urban metro. People don&#x27;t usually go straight home to their closet sized apartment. They stay out for hours before going home and usually they don&#x27;t have a car.</i><p>This device doesn&#x27;t solve that problem at all.  Unless you assume you&#x27;re going to buy two of these things, one for the office and one for home, at which point you&#x27;re clearly talking about people with significant amounts of disposable cash who could solve this many other ways.  A cheap desktop&#x2F;laptop at home and remote desktop to work solves this for work stuff.  So does OneDrive or Office 365 or Google Drive or DropBox or Box or a number of other services that you can definitely afford if you would even consider buying two of these just to avoid carrying your laptop home because you want to hang out in a bar for a few hours.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s like arguing headphones are bad because you can&#x27;t use them without an audio device. This is just a bad argument. Both headphones and this dock augment the products that they pair with; not being an independent product doesn&#x27;t make it bad.</i><p>It makes it bad when the alternative is a standalone device that solves all the same problems and delivers many extra features for little extra money.<p>A better analogy than regular headphones might be noise-cancelling headphones.  You can buy a set of noise-cancelling headphones that operate by themselves.  A hypothetical set of headphones that cost $30 less but can&#x27;t be used by themselves because they rely on the phone to pick up the ambient noise would be a terrible option.  It&#x27;s not enough cheaper to justify the need to tether to a phone for functionality that the standalone product delivers better.<p>&gt; <i>Yet the price eventually came down and now they&#x27;re a force to be reckoned with even though they still have most of the weaknesses that pundits complained about. It&#x27;s still possible to buy a real laptop for a little more cash. I&#x27;m pretty sure this favors my side of the argument and not yours.</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t favor the argument that this specifically is a good product.  If you can pick up one for $30 in a few years, I might feel differently.<p>&gt; <i>How can you be so sure about this? Installing an app is much easier than syncing two or more devices. Besides this isn&#x27;t only issue preventing sync, which again you&#x27;re conveniently ignoring.</i><p>If you can install an app and use it for this, you can install an app and use it for sync.  Sync isn&#x27;t rocket science.  You&#x27;re also conveniently ignoring the other issues with this device, such as the fact that most apps don&#x27;t support, e.g., resizeable and multiple windows.<p>&gt; <i>I was speaking about the long term potential of the device, and not short term, initial quarterly sales figures. Chromebook wouldn&#x27;t exist if Google made its decision solely on the 1st year of sales.</i><p>I actually don&#x27;t think it has much long-term potential either, because by the time this device hits a reasonable price point, chromebooks and laptops will still be close.<p>&gt; <i>And phones with installed movies and video games don&#x27;t?</i><p>No moreso than laptops&#x2F;chromebooks with the same videogames and movies installed.  If you mostly want to watch movies and play games, you can also buy a tablet for $50 and probably be happier than you would with either of these options.<p>&gt; <i>Yes it totally makes sense for them to market a Chinese product for American Kickstarter backers. &#x2F;s rural China isn&#x27;t the only part of the developing world either. You&#x27;re thinking in too limited of a time frame and too small of a geographic area as well as demographic, it doesn&#x27;t have room for vision.</i><p>I was using your example.  If you rephase it in terms of any other developing area, the same criticism applies, because there&#x27;s no developing area I&#x27;m aware of using North American plugs and an English qwerty keyboard.  I get that you think this product will develop into something useful over time, but I think a standalone laptop will always be right there costing barely more and delivering more value.<p>I think they&#x27;re targeting the US audience because you&#x27;ve got to market something like this to people with significant disposable cash because it delivers little actual value beyond novelty.<p>&gt; <i>The iPhone wasn&#x27;t a good product.

"No one has ever made a vacuum tube 600km long with a cross-section of over a meter. Much less one that has to maintain vacuum with a super heavy train going at 400m&#x2F;s. This is at least an order of magnitude more difficult than anything of the same nature. It&#x27;s really not comparable to anything in existence. CERN is a Tonka truck by comparison.<p>Burying the lines would already make it an order of magnitude more expensive than what was promised. And now you have to compensate for ground movements, since your tube is fat and hundreds of kilometers in length, which makes it even more expensive.<p>Insulating the tubes to maintain temperature would be incredibly costly, and if there ever was a failure or natural disaster that prevented you from keeping up the power need, your tube <i>will break</i>.<p>Materials that have such little temperature change coefficients are much too expensive to build a 600km long multiple meter wide tube with.<p>If you allow the tubes to change length, your stations will move, sometimes in unpredictable directions. You also risk gigantic stresses caused by temperature differentials causing bending forces.<p>Vacuum expansion joints of that scale, for such a length, with such reliability are literally unheard of.

"I&#x27;m skeptical about the cheaper per KWh. A 100W conventional turbine can be purchased for around $200 and has 3 blades around 50 cm in length. The 100W vortex device is 2.7m tall and I doubt can be purchased for less than $600 since the structure is much wider and weighs around 3 times more. 14kg vs 5kg for a conventional turbine.<p>A 100W conventional turbine also only has a couple of moving parts, won&#x27;t kill birds and is effectively silent. I&#x27;m unsure on wether these claims are still true as the device scales up. A device 100m or so tall will have a fast velocity at the tip perhaps as much as 50m&#x2F;s at a few Hz which is similar to the blade tip speed of a conventional turbine thus having similar potential to kill birds and make noise."

Is it the author speaking about having bad hardware and configuration?<p>&gt; In real life, if you had your devices close enough to each other and to the access point, about the best you could reasonably expect [with 802.11b] was 1 Mbps—about 125 KB&#x2F;sec.<p>I used 802.11b a lot. In a non crowded situation reaching ~5.5mbit was not a problem at all. I remember seeing transfer speeds of about 700KB&#x2F;s.<p>Why the author ignores the theoretical top speed which is something around ~60% of 11mbit is beyond me.<p>Then the author continues with the same thing again;<p>&gt;your best case scenario [with 802.11g] tended to be about a tenth of that—5 Mbps or so<p>This again is not true. In a non crowded situation I had no issues reaching 2-3MB&#x2F;s, which is closer to the theoretical limits of 802.11g after factoring in some signal loss.<p>Surely, today when everybody is having wifi you would probably not reach 700KB&#x2F;s on 802.11b or 3MB&#x2F;s on 802.11g, but back when it began it was actually feasible."

"The headline made me expect several things until I saw that it was Khronos, the group that gives us, among other things, OpenGL API&#x27;s.  Looks like the Next Generation OpenGL is getting more ready to show off.<p>With Metal and Mantle, it was clear that graphics programmers were wanting to use GPU&#x27;s at lower levels of abstraction to more efficiently utilize the design of GPU&#x27;s, which have a much different architecture than a decade ago.  Without a corresponding option that is standards compliant, low-level API&#x27;s are threatening to fragment GPU programming.<p>One operation I didn&#x27;t see any mention of that seems to have some future role, albeit completely uncertain, is the Heterogeneous System Architecture Foundation spear-headed by AMD and having seemingly every chip-maker except Nvidia and Intel on-board.<p>As GPU stream processors get more CPU-like but are natural at parallel processing, it is a matter of time before we get the right abstractions so that map gets scheduled across many stream processors and is reduced by a higher-single-thread performance CPU and suddenly computer vision and many other naturally parallel data synthesis workloads are programmed in a less heterogeneous software environment and executed on chips where the stream processors and CPU&#x27;s share a large amount of commonalities, possibly down to micro-op compatibility through something Nvidia could be pushing towards in their Denver architecture (as yet highly speculative).<p>To somewhat less than enthusiastic coverage, Nvidia has been building up their partnerships with automakers like crazy.  Computer vision is obviously one of the applications that will be required in self-driving cars.  Tango and other projects are also quiet beneficiaries of Nvidia tech maturing into the Tegra platform.<p>We have far from conquered programming and CPU design just because JIT&#x27;s are good, 8GB of RAM is expected or GPU&#x27;s can mine MHashes&#x2F;s etc.  We&#x27;re in some future&#x27;s bad-old-days.

"For wired internet, I suspect that a lot of people are paying for much faster connections than they actually need. As you note, e-mail, streaming video, playing online games, and browsing generally don&#x27;t need a lot of speed. Latency and packet loss are far more important.<p>25 Mbit&#x2F;s is fine for streaming one 4K UHD video with surround sound.<p>It is mainly just large downloads where speed matters. Downloading a new game, or a big update to a game you have, or a major OS upgrade, will usually take longer on a slower connection. (Not always, because the server might not be fast enough. Not everyone pays the bandwidth costs to allow their download servers to support a bazillion simultaneous gigabit&#x2F;s downloads).<p>When I dropped cable TV&#x2F;phone and went internet only, I decided to cut my speed from 600 Mbit&#x2F;s ($90&#x2F;month plan) to 100 Mbit&#x2F;s ($55&#x2F;month) to see if it was good enough. (If not, it could be raised easily just by placing an order on Comcast&#x27;s website. No need to even interact with a human--they only make you interact with a human if you are trying to do something that will lower your bill).<p>That was 6 months ago, and it is still sitting at 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. I almost never notice that it is slower than it once was. Most large downloads I do are things I download in the background while doing other things, and then get to sometime later. For most of them, all the change from 600 to 100 did was mean that the gap between the download finishing and my getting around to wanting the data is smaller.<p>One other important consideration is uploading. My old 600 plan had something like 25 Mbit&#x2F;s upload. My 100 plan only has 7 Mbit&#x2F;s upload. That sometimes is noticeable, such as when I need to upload a file to a server for work, then ssh to the server to do something there with the file."
"Hmm it didn&#x27;t seem horribly misleading to me, either before or after reading the article. They <i>are</i> trying to stop state investigations. The title doesn&#x27;t say anything about Big Cable paying off anyone, that&#x27;s jumping to conclusions not stated in the title.<p>There is a uniform national standard set by the FCC, but we have lots of federal laws that exceed or are exceeded by state laws. I&#x27;m not sure I understand why this would confuse consumers. I&#x27;m also not sure how big of a bandwidth measurement difference there can be, the article didn&#x27;t elaborate on that... what different ways are there to measure or enforce 50Mb&#x2F;s, and how far apart can they get? Is the problem more about what 50Mb&#x2F;s means, or is it more about the differences in sustained bandwidth requirements?<p>How does this whole argument change if states agree to use the exact same measurements and criteria the FCC uses, but retain the ability to monitor and prosecute violations independently?<p>I feel like the subtext, reading between the lines, is the cable companies don&#x27;t care about the &quot;patchwork&quot; problem, they just want less enforcement. The FCC can&#x27;t cover everything, and they don&#x27;t have that much power to stop cable if cable breaks the rules, especially in localized areas. Nor do they historically exercise that power unless things have gotten really far out of hand. Having states retain the ability to watch their own backs seems like a good idea to me."

"Mining on all four cores of my CPU with CPUminer gets me about 80 kh&#x2F;s, while mining on my GPU gets me about 270 kh&#x2F;s. The GPU also uses about twice as much electricity when it&#x27;s mining, so the CPU isn&#x27;t completely terrible in comparison (although my CPU gets a lot hotter while mining, and the fans get a lot louder). However, I have an Nvidia GPU, which is less good at mining than an otherwise comparable AMD GPU. With an AMD GPU the disparity would be a few times greater.<p>CPU mining isn&#x27;t really profitable unless you don&#x27;t have to pay for electricity.

"&gt; 80% (30% with zero) of the country&#x2F;population has 0-1 options for 25Mbps and 92% (55% with zero) of the country&#x2F;population have 0-1 options for 100Mbps<p>Good data, though these numbers still are pretty much the same. The data you linked rates <i>10&#x2F;25 Mbps not 25&#x2F;100 Mbps when rating competition in areas</i>. Most people still only have 0 or 1 options at 25&#x2F;100 Mbps.<p>There has been a small bump in 25 Mbps. But even then they are only are up a bit. However, 49% for 25Mbps is still pathetically sad, up under 20% only in 4 years as they did little &#x27;16-present to help push NN removal.<p>They fail to highlight that most places with &#x27;multiple broadband providers&#x27;, of over 10 Mbps which is not really broadband that is good for today, typically have one provider at 100Mbps or higher and the other false competition at 10-12 Mbps so they just barely rate at the low 10Mbps pathetic broadband classification. ISPs also still have great interest in their local monopolies, which still more than <i>half the population</i> are under at 25 Mbps, and more than 2&#x2F;3rds under 100Mbps local monopolies, only 10% have gigabit available and those areas have no competitive option, not good enough for the US.<p>Much of the move to 100 Mbps, which the broadband cable companies could do more easily with DOCSIS anyday they like, was the result of areas that Google Fiber entered.  Cox for instance was 25 Mbps down here until Google Fiber then suddenly they got 100&#x2F;300 Mbps and started offering gigablast&#x2F;gigabit but that quickly stopped after Google pulled out. REAL competition is good. Saying competition is one provider with 100Mbps and the competitor at 10Mbps is not real competition.<p>Most of the US is still under local monopolies for 25 Mbps service (0 or 1 option only), and nearly all of the US is under local monopoly for 100+ Mbps, unacceptable.<p>So now that ISPs have net neutrality removed I am sure we will see <i>multiple 100 Mbps competitive products and gigabit service rapidly rolling out</i> across the country right? &#x2F;s"

"Video storage and delivery is expensive. YouTube can make money because they&#x27;re piggybacking on Google&#x27;s massive infrastructure.<p>Building a tracker&#x2F;aggregator (like PeerTube etc) is straight forward. It&#x27;s actually getting video content to clients that is challenging. Video is both large and sensitive to internal ordering. You need packet 1 before you can do anything with packet 2, if you have those but packet 3 is stalled you can&#x27;t go forward.<p>To serve video you need enough online storage to actually house it but then enough upstream bandwidth (and good latency) to serve it to clients in real-time. Serving up HD streams at a reasonable bitrate will quickly saturate a gigabit connection.<p>A network of HTTP servers or even an overlay network like IPFS don&#x27;t help solve these problems. Video needs a lot of storage and is very sensitive to a server&#x27;s upstream capacity.<p>Torrent based streaming can distribute that load but introduces its own problems. Torrent based streaming clients just request video content blocks in sequential order versus normal BT clients just accepting a random ordering of blocks. But again unless you&#x27;ve got a bunch of high bandwidth seeders it&#x27;s difficult to serve content at playable rates. If the content is encoded to use 5Mb&#x2F;s in order to play it back without buffering you need it delivered at least that rate.<p>Both methods to distribute video suffer from popularity problems. If transitional servers stop hosting old&#x2F;unpopular content or seeders for it drop off it becomes unavailable on the network even if it&#x27;s still referenced in the aggregator.<p>Not that YouTube is an overall good service or that monopolies in the space are good but online video is an area that gravitates towards centralization if not monopolies. If you want to compete with YouTube, or more likely Vimeo or another smaller player, you&#x27;d need to replicate their infrastructure. That&#x27;s the difficult&#x2F;expensive thing to build and maintain. Other self-hosted services are trivial by comparison."

"I might need a reality check here because this is feeling weird.<p>I&#x27;m currently building a web-based application to store JVM threaddumps. This includes a JS-based frontend to efficiently sort and filter sets of JVM threads (for example based on thread names, or classes included in thread traces). Or the ability to visualize locking structures with d3, so you can see that a specific class is a bottle neck because it has many locks and many threads are waiting for it.<p>I&#x27;m doing that in a Ruby&#x2F;Vue application because those choices make the app easy. You can upload a threaddump via curl, and share it with everyone via links. You can share sorted and filtered thread sets, you can share visualizations with a mostly readable link. This is good because it&#x27;s easy to - automatically - collect and upload thread ddumps, and it&#x27;s easy to collaborate with a problematic locking situation.<p>So, I&#x27;d call that a fairly heavy web-based application. I&#x27;m relying on JS, because JS makes my user experience better. JS can fetch a threaddump, cache it in the browser, and execute filters based on the cached data pretty much as fast as a native application would. Except you can share and link it easily, so it&#x27;s better than visualvm or TDA.<p>But with all that heavywheight, fast moving web bollocks... Isn&#x27;t it natural to think about web latency? To me it&#x27;s the only sensible thing to webpack&#x2F;gulp-concat&#x2F;whatever my entire app so all that heavy JS is one big GET. It&#x27;s the only sensible thing to fetch all information about a threaddump in on GET just to cache it and have it available. It&#x27;s the only right thing to do or else network latency eats you alive.<p>Am I <i>that</i> estranged by now by having worked on one low-latency, high-throughput application by now? To avoid confusion, the threaddump storage is neither low-latency, nor high-throughput. Talking java with 100k+ events&#x2F;s and &lt; 1ms in-server latency there."

"I think a no-deal is very likely at this point. It will be interesting to see how much everything was hyped by media and what are the real lessons for other countries ... Could it really be that a complex set of contracts is so poorly implemented that the exit conditions will push a state over the brink ?? If yes then I wonder how nobody thought about risk and contingency - after all contracts can always be reviewed, re-negotiated and revised. Preferably every couple of years. If EU membership is a one way road that can only be untangled with economic hardship (or even civil war) then other countries should start thinking for their own contingency. Even they don&#x27;t intend to leave it&#x27;s just good practice ... Similar like Russia planning to shut off their connection to the rest of the Internet. If you don&#x27;t plan for such scenarios and practice resilience and recovery it&#x27;ll eventually end in tears (whatever system&#x2F;s you build)."

"No.  ELK is a slow and expensive way to store and retrieve logs.  The reason people use it is that nothing else exists.  (I was blown away when I started using it at my last job.  I used the fluentd Kubernetes daemonset to extract logs from k8s and into ES... and the &quot;cat a file and send it over the network&quot; thing uses 300+MB of RAM per node.  There is an alternate daemon that can be used now, but wow.  300MB to tail some files and parse JSON.)<p>I think a better strategy is to store logs in flat files with several replicas.  Do your metric generation in realtime, regexing a bunch of logs on a bunch of workers as they come in.  (I handled &gt; 250MB&#x2F;s on less than one Google production machine, though did eventually shard it up for better schedulability and disaster resilience.  Also those 10Gb NICs start to feel slow when a bunch of log sources come back after a power outage!)<p>For simple lookups like &quot;show me all the logs in the last 5 minutes&quot;, you can maintain an index of timestamp -&gt; log file in a standard database, and do additional filtering on whatever is retrieving the files.  You can also probably afford to index other things, like x-request-id and maybe a trigram index of messages, and actually be able to debug full request cycles in a handful of milliseconds when necessary.  For complicated queries, you can just mapreduce it.  After using ES, you will also be impressed at how fast grepping a flat file for your search term is.<p>The problem is, the machinery to do this easily doesn&#x27;t exist.  Everything is designed for average performance at large scale, instead of great performance at medium scale.  Someday I plan to fix this, but I just don&#x27;t see a business case, so it&#x27;s low priority.  Would you fund someone who can make your log queries faster?  Nope.  &quot;Next time we won&#x27;t have a production issue that the logs will help debug.&quot;  And so, there&#x27;s nothing good."
"Video Games, Songs on iTunes, Internet, Phone Services... The list goes on, pretty much everything is expensive over here, even digital products with zero shipping or handling costs are triple or more the price in the US. For example I pay $70&#x2F;month for 200GB of &#x27;broadband&#x27; that peaks at 500kb&#x2F;s and is totally incapable of streaming video. My mobile phone costs $95&#x2F;month and I get 5GB of data."
"I&#x27;m only familiar with the basics of the networks capabilities per my former position as a technician for WildBlue&#x2F;Exede. Connecting directly through satellite is certainly possible if more people were interested in it. Our satellite networks are still fairly basic primarily because there&#x27;s not been a historical abundance of interest in the technology due to its limitations compared to terrestrial networking.<p>ViaSat-1 is (as far as I&#x27;m aware) the most capable satellite currently in orbit, with a rate of 140 Gbit&#x2F;s. Its bandwidth capacity  when launched larger than all of the other North American satellites combined.<p>I would be VERY surprised to learn that the fundamental issue with this would be spectrum capacity, as the K band satellites operate in is very wide.<p>The way current satellite technologies typically deal with concurrent data streams is to split up into &#x27;beams&#x27; that cover a specific region. Currently VS1 uses 72 bands but they&#x27;re spread all over Canada and the US. With more satellites and tighter beam placement it&#x27;s certainly feasible to have millions of simultaneous connections.<p>I feel like I kind of rambled on there - if there&#x27;s anything in particular you&#x27;d like me to expand upon I&#x27;d be happy to (and if someone notices I&#x27;m wrong about anything please let me know!)."
"<i>&gt; This all changed, of course. Computing power eventually became a secondary draw to user experience. That&#x27;s partly because broadband exploded, making sheer speed less of a selling point.</i><p>So here I am, with my beefy SSD machine, a 50 Mbit&#x2F;s connection, a JS engine that is orders of magnitude faster than anything we had a few years ago, HTML5 offline storage, HTTP&#x2F;2, still waiting &gt;5sec for several Google properties to load, waiting &gt;15sec for CEF-based Spotify to load, knowing that with today&#x27;s tech, these things could fire up within &lt;100ms.<p>It&#x27;s no disaster if I have to wait for a few seconds, but especially for secondary tasks (like looking up an address on Maps or playing a song) which I do en passant while focusing on something else, I find that waiting for only a few seconds can already steal my focus. When I fire up a music app (be it non-Google Spotify, Google Play Music or whatever), it would be great if at least the search form was available immediately. Knowing that it won&#x27;t, that instead my expensive PC will go sluggish for a few moments, I find myself just avoiding these things increasingly often.<p>And it&#x27;s sad to know that Google once <i>was</i> pretty obsessed about reducing these little latencies wherever possible. Today, they develop SPDY and QUIC to save a few ms, then throw web frameworks at me that take whole seconds to load.<p>It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t appreciate beautiful interface design. It&#x27;s nice to have a mobile OS that arguably looks better than iOS. But it also was pretty awesome to have an almost latency-free experience (and good information design, making efficient use of my screen), even with an old netbook and shaky GPRS internet on the train."

"A 160km altitude cubesat would require a minimum 7.8km&#x2F;s of delta-v. Anything less than that and it will burn up in the atmosphere after a few orbits.

"These are bogus arguments that <i>sound</i> reasonable in the absence of a relevant comparison but are all flimsy and uninformed upon inspection.<p>For example, by what definition would this not be &#x27;safe&#x27;? Do you mean in comparison to Firefox&#x27;s defaults, which enable profoundly privacy-invasive tracking, hide the contents of the cookie management dialog box, and enable the delivery of malvertising at will by visiting &quot;safe&quot; websites - just to name a few?<p>MitM positions exist on the internet for all users <i>today</i>, both for HTTP and in the situation of &quot;new HTTPS bugs&quot;. So you point out risks taken when using the internet <i>in general</i>, and the Tor Browser Bundle already mitigates many of those risks via NoScript and various patches. I&#x27;ve used Tor Browser Bundle daily for all purposes - including online banking and shopping - for several years with zero problems. Malicious exits exist and get flagged out of the network rapidly. Essentially all remaining risk is trivially defeated by toggling the &#x27;block all unencrypted requests&#x27; pref in HTTPSEverywhere, which is part of the Tor Browser Bundle and could be built into an implementation in Firefox with a warning for HTTP traffic.<p>And you&#x27;re probably thinking of 2009-era Tor network experience. For me, Tor network performance routinely boils down to ~200ms additional latency with ~1.5-2MB&#x2F;s download speeds. The difference between that and an average broadband connection is barely noticeable.<p>I recommend using the Tor network and the Tor Browser Bundle before criticizing this idea."

"I found out about de Bruijn sequences while brute forcing a digital door lock (it was my own door, my landlord changes the code sometimes).

"I came here to say the same thing.  I might have to make it myself which is looking increasingly possible.

"I bought some 802.11AC router from Asus a few months ago for around that much, and I was absolutely floored at how much better it was than my old WRT54GS that I had been using with DD-WRT for years. Now I&#x27;m easily able to download consistently at 16MB&#x2F;s from the internet, and do large file transfers at even higher rates between devices at home. I&#x27;ve mostly stopped using gigabit ethernet at home even because it&#x27;s so fast."
"The TCP protocol needs to be able buffer one round trip time (RTT) worth of data at both sender and receiver in the kernel.  It needs one RTT of data at the receiver to cope with waiting for a retransmission of a lost packet, or just so it doesn&#x27;t drop incoming packets when the receiving app doesn&#x27;t read immediately.  The same amount of data must be buffered at the sender because it may need to be retransmitted if a packet was lost.  So, 6MiB of buffering with a fairly typical 100ms RTT gives you 6*8&#x2F;0.1 Mbit&#x2F;s = 480Mbit&#x2F;s.  In practice you may need more buffering than this, but that&#x27;s the maximum rate you can achieve.<p>Now, if you&#x27;ve got an overbuffered router at the bottleneck, as is common on home broadband links, you can build a queue there.  It&#x27;s not really all that unusual to see queues build to 1 second, especially on ADSL.  If you&#x27;ve a 1 second RTT, the maximum rate you can support with 6MiB of buffering at both sender and receiver drops to 48Mbit&#x2F;s.  It seems to me that 6MiB is a fairly reasonable default value, though if you&#x27;re running a really busy server, you might benefit from reducing this, especially if you&#x27;re mostly serving small files."

"As I said, the benchmark is flawed since it&#x27;s dependent on the network pipe.

"&quot;graphics memory&quot; is probably not the right term here. While the Pro SSG does have 2TB of storage on board, that comes in the form of a NAND flash, PCIe SSD (from Samsung IIRC).

"They roughly infer their mass (in kilograms) by assuming 9.8m&#x2F;s&#x2F;s gravitational acceleration and using a scale to judge how much mass the resulting &#x27;push&#x27; would require given that pull.

"I once recovered a stolen car with ping.<p>It was 2002 (2003?), and we had just launched Zipcar in New York. Being a naive start-up we had perhaps not the most stringent security measures in place to prevent fraud and theft. Sure enough, a couple of weeks in and one of our cars went missing. Calls to the member went unreturned, and it became clear that the member was not who they claimed to be and had no intention of returning the car.<p>At the time Zipcar was using the mobile analog CDPD network for vehicle communications, which had a top speed of something like 19.2k&#x2F;s and cost us around $1&#x2F;month per KB of data. However, it also had a limited number of data channels, and since it used the old AMPS network broadcast in the 800 - 900 MHz range. I happened to have an amateur radio license and a radio that was able to receive in that band.<p>Since we were still in contact with the missing car we knew it hadn&#x27;t been chopped (yet) and I figured we might be able to use some sort of radio direction finding technique to locate the car. My friend and fellow engineer Carl was able to reprogram the firmware of our embedded electronics to tell us which cell tower the car was in contact with, and with that we could look up the FCC id in their database to find the tower&#x27;s street address.<p>So my boss Roy and I hopped into his car and drove to Long Island. We drove up to the tower, and I leaned out the window of his minivan with a yagi antenna and my radio (set to scan the 40 or so CDPD channels.) We asked Carl (back in Boston) to start pinging the car. To the radio this sounded like a half-second burst of static, but since it was very regular it was also very easy to identify. Sure enough, after driving around for a few minutes we picked up the signal. <i>pffft</i> <i>pffft</i> <i>pffft</i><p>We drove around the tower in a wide circle until the signal was the strongest, got out to scan the area, then used the new bearing to reduce the circle. Eventually we ended up in the parking lot of the Long Island railroad. There in the back corner was our car, luckily unscathed and none the worse for wear.<p>Ping rocks."

"I&#x27;ve read both of Christopher Alexander&#x27;s (CA) books and Zen ATAO Motorcycle Maintenance (Zen). I think the way Zen talks about QWAN is a better description than CA&#x27;s, I would call when things fit together and work together well &#x27;Elegance&#x27; rather than QWAN. 
Pattern Mining is one thing and very worthwhile (to find Elegance) but without Quality the end product will be average at best.<p>The Zen description of QWAN is more about &#x27;what is Quality&#x27; or &#x27;where does quality come from&#x27;. Yes, elegance plays a part in the overall structure but without QWAN it would be a pretty average &#x27;object&#x27;. For example, the design of the car has an &#x27;elegance&#x27; in its design but without the Zen &#x27;Quality&#x27; would probably not be put together well and be unreliable and shoddy&#x2F;buggy but it&#x27;s still a car built with all the patterns.<p>Quality comes from the knowledge, experience, effort and undivided attention put in by the craftsperson creating the &#x27;object&#x27; at a given point in time. The train analogy from Zen explains this well and it&#x27;s basically about focus in the moment you are doing something. This produces Quality, nothing else. You could argue that the parts to make up the car example above would give it Quality and fix most of the issues in the final product. This is true but only if every step in it&#x27;s production, from mining the minerals, design, drafting and manufacture were given with the same focus.<p>As far as software patterns are concerned I think we have strayed too far from inherent Elegance to strive for some other abstracted Elegance (inherent Elegance takes longer to control&#x2F;master!). The computer is very simple at its low level core (how it computes at least) but we keep building languages to make it simpler at a much higher level and in the process have made things very In-Elegant in between these levels.
We had (and still have) languages that take on the lowest level and abstract it to a higher level very simply, the most obvious being Lisp and Forth but the lack of processing power made them untenable for their time. Both of these languages have the &#x27;Elegance&#x27; CA discusses, you have complete freedom in creating the language&#x2F;s and language features you need, put some Pattern Mining in with some Quality and you really have something!"

The reason it&#x27;s easier for ejecta to get from Mars to Earth than vice versa is that Mars has a shallower gravity well to climb out of before making the inter-planetary trip.  It&#x27;s a lot easier for an impact to impart the ~6 km&#x2F;s velocity you need to get from the surface of Mars to hitting Earth&#x27;s atmosphere than the ~13 km&#x2F;s it takes to get from Earth&#x27;s surface to hitting Mars."

"I&#x27;m surprised that neither GNU yes nor GNU cat uses splice(2). Here&#x27;s what I get.

In all tests the default string of &quot;y\n&quot; is used.<p><pre><code>  $ .&#x2F;rust | cat &gt;&#x2F;dev&#x2F;null

As you can see, cat(1) is the real bottleneck.<p>splice is Linux-only. Most systems have sendfile(2), including Linux, but I didn&#x27;t test it. The implementation and semantics of sendfile vary across platforms.<p>[1] I did this before I wrote .&#x2F;consume (which takes an optional byte count limit), having assumed that GNU cat was using splice. As cat doesn&#x27;t have a way to limit the number of bytes read&#x2F;written, and other tools like head or tail definitely don&#x27;t use splice, the simplest way to limit the benchmark without introducing a bottleneck was to have the producers themselves print stats and exit. The relevant diff is<p><pre><code>    + let mut count = 0u64 as usize;
    + let bytes = (1u64 &lt;&lt; 33) as usize;
    ...
    -while locked.write_all(filled).is_ok() {}
    +while locked.write_all(filled).is_ok() {

"Yes, they can do traditional cryptography pretty well (depending on the algorithm, of course.) AES-128 in an FPGA can encrypt a full 16-byte block every clock cycle when done right. With 100Mhz clock that&#x27;s about 2.3Gbp&#x2F;s, well within SATA 3 transfer speeds. You can achieve that with a last-last-gen FPGA that will cost you a couple bucks out of pocket, and it will use a fraction of the power&#x2F;thermal footprint of any desktop&#x2F;mobile processor that doesn&#x27;t have AES support. Likewise, you can easily scale this up -- 10gig&#x2F;s isn&#x27;t even worth mentioning because it&#x27;s trivial, so you can think closer to 40Gbp&#x2F;s and beyond (which, today -- still not that impressive, I&#x27;m just giving you an idea.)<p>The thing is, if you&#x27;re going to do ubiquitous encryption for something like your SATA link at scale, with a lot of units being sold -- you&#x27;re better off just using a dedicated ASIC with a fixed algorithm, and your performance&#x2F;power profile will skyrocket even further."

"The split is actually much more uneven, and heavily on the side of kinetic energy.<p>An orbit at 200 km altitude has an orbital velocity of 7.79 km&#x2F;s. Potential energy is given by m * g * h (to good approximation, as h is much smaller than the Earth radius of 6300 km) and kinetic energy goes as 0.5 m v^2. Per unit mass (that appears identically in both energy forms) we have potential energy of g * h = 9.81 m &#x2F; s^2 * 2e5 m = 1.96e6 m^2&#x2F;s^2. For kinetic energy we find 0.5 * (7.79e3 m&#x2F;s)^2 = 3e7 m^2&#x2F;s^2. So only 6% of energy are potential energy, 94% are kinetic energy.<p>For a relatively high orbit with 1500 km and 7.12 km&#x2F;s the ratio becomes a more even 37% to 63%. If we include the extra 1.5km&#x2F;s of delta-v that we loose to drag it becomes 28% to 72%.<p>At the typical parameters of stage separation from the first stage the split is 3% to 97%. This is also why replacing the first stage by an airplane (that only gets you altitude, not that much speed) does buy you a lot less than you might think at first. We still need a rocket to go to space, even if you start 12km up."

"Lunar speed reentry is quite feasible, and has been practiced. Apollo did it fine, and Orion did it a few weeks ago. State of the art ablative shields, like the PICA-X used on Stardust and Dragon, are quite capable of handling entry at Mars transfer speed. (Lunar entry profile is about 11km&#x2F;s, Mars 13-14km&#x2F;s--though it can go as high as 20km&#x2F;s deformation on design.)<p>The real problem with the return trip is getting off Mars. Specifically, putting enough propellant on the surface to get you back up. Sure, it&#x27;s easier than Earth, but it&#x27;s still a planet. If NASA were serious about Mars, they would be sending prototype ISRU plants every cycle, because having rocket fuel waiting for you on the surface is the real enabling technology for Mars exploration.

You&#x27;d need to have very clever ways to emulate the &quot;Emotion Engine&quot;, like VPU0 and VPU1 vector processors. A single RPi4 core would far exceed those, but using it in an emulator might be very hard, because you&#x27;ll probably need to synchronize execution and to emulate PS2 internal memory model. Emulating PS2 300 MHz MIPS core would be a walk in the park compared with the other issues.<p>But memory bandwidth might be the true showstopper. I think RPi4 has just one 32-bit DDR4 channel at 2400 MHz, which yields just 9.6 GB&#x2F;s theoretical maximum bandwidth. More than what PS2 got, but the margins for emulation are uncomfortably low.<p>So while it&#x27;s &quot;possible&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll happen at playable framerates. It&#x27;d be <i>easier</i> to reverse engineer the rendering engines in popular PS2 games and to simply <i>port</i> them."

Electric current moves slightly slower than the speed of light through copper and silicon but its close enough to approximate here. That means in a CPU running at 1 THz it would take multiple clock cycles for a signal to move from one side of the CPU to the other. You also have to take into account the switching speed of transistors and the distance from the CPU to memory. All together, you would just end up wasting a lot of clock cycles achieving nothing and driving the current required to run a CPU at those speeds would generate a lot of heat."

"Heh (on the jobs paused bits) ... most modern shared file systems are HA (or nearly HA) except when people build them cheaply.  And then you get an effective RAID0.<p>I was pointing out that if you are doing the analytics at AWS or similar on-demand scenario (a common pattern I see people trying&#x2F;using and eventually rejecting), you have a serial data motion step to distribute data to your data lake before processing.  Then you extract your results, decommission all those servers.  Rinse, and repeat.<p>The point is, that for ephermal compute&#x2F;storage scenarios, you have a set of poorly architected resources tied together in a way that pretty much guarantees you have a large (dominant) serial step before anything goes in parallel.<p>What we advocate (and have been doing so for more than a decade), are far more capable building blocks of storage+compute.  So if you are going to build a system to process a large amount of data, instead of buying 1000 nodes and managing them, buy 20-50 far more capable nodes at a small fraction of the price, and get the same&#x2F;better performance.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t take 0 seconds.  There is a distribution&#x2F;management overhead (very much non-zero), as well as data motion overhead for results (depending upon the nature of the query).  When you subdivide the problems finely enough, the query management overhead actually dominates the computation (which was another aspect of the point I made, but it wasn&#x27;t explicit on my part).<p>So we are fine with building hadoop&#x2F;spark&#x2F;kdb+ systems ... we just want them built out of units that can move 10-20GB&#x2F;s between storage and processing.  Which lets you hit 50-100s per TB of processed data.  Which gives you a fighting chance at dealing with PB scale problems in reasonable time frames, which a number of our users have."

Similar for my Electron&#x2F;X11 fullscreen based GUI for the phone (also in the video).

"&gt; They are buying more bandwidth so they can get it cheaper.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s actually true. The first assumption, that they are buying something from someone else is potentially flawed, and the conclusion is based on another potentially flawed assumption, that bandwidth has an inherent volume discount.<p>I say &quot;potentially&quot; flawed because these assumptions easily hold true for small enough providers and little enough bandwidth.<p>At large provider scale, it&#x27;s probably safer to assume that they&#x27;re building instead of buying, and those costs follow fairly large, discrete steps.<p>Increasing bandwidth means buying faster DWM modules and, possibly, higher-end equipment that supports them. It might mean doing that for their network peer, too.<p>In many cases, I expect it would mean bypassing shared infrastructure like internet exchanges, which might be limited to as little as 10Gb&#x2F;s or even 1Gb&#x2F;s and getting direct peering arrangements (including physical connections) with other networks, including possibly reimbursing them for their costs. This can be complicated by the new peer only having just enough bandwidth to that exchange point to match the exchange&#x27;s maximum bandwidth, in which case peering will require co-locating somewhere else, with all the hardware and (hopefully dark but not always possible) fiber leasing costs.<p>None of those costs are necessarily high if considering maximum available bandwidth, such as if they spent 5x to get 20x or even 100x the capacity. However, if they only did it for a single customer that, on <i>average</i> only uses 2x the bandwidth (and only peaks at 20x-100x at rare times or only on certain, unpredictable in advance, connections to peers), they experienced a volume premium, rather than a discount."

"These shouldn&#x27;t require IPC at GB&#x2F;s speed either. Modern sandboxes, like the one in Chrome, have a broker process which can open filesystem objects, device objects and sockets (file descriptors or handles) and pass them to a sandboxed decoder&#x2F;renderer process, so there would be no need to stream filesystem data to the sandbox when the sandbox could do the file I&#x2F;O itself. Even for Matroska ordered chapters, where the demuxer would have to tell the broker which files to open, the broker could enforce certain rules, such as enforcing that local mkv files only reference other local files, the files are all in the same directory, and that the files are always opened in read-only mode.<p>As for isolating decoders from video filters and chroma conversion, I&#x27;m not sure why that would be necessary, since those shouldn&#x27;t require any additional privileges. I understand that retrofitting an existing program to use a multi-process sandboxing model is far from easy, and I&#x27;m definitely not volunteering to do it, but I don&#x27;t think there is anything specific about a video player that is harder to sandbox than a web browser."

"&gt; If hash capacity were traded on a perfectly competitive market, then it would always make sense to rent 51% of the capacity at market rates, earn the transaction fees, and also perform a double-spending attack. There is no equilibrium point for transaction fees where this attack becomes uneconomical. The only defense is that the market for hash capacity is imperfect.<p>At this point in time the current hashrate of the bitcoin network is 32.500 PH&#x2F;s, up from 5.000 PH&#x2F;s a year ago and 1.400 PH&#x2F;s two years ago. If you rent 51% of the network it&#x27;s going to be rather obvious that something is happening, that will however not prevent an attack. Let us assume that you can rent capacity because the miners are greedy, what price would you have to pay? Let&#x27;s assume that you can buy from miners that want to exit the mining business, so they do not care about deprecating the value of their hardware nor the bitcoin value itself.<p>So the assumptions are that 51% of the available capacity don&#x27;t care if bitcoin tank and burn as long as they profit enough, and you&#x27;re able to buy that. A 0.43% difficulty increase daily (average over last 2 years), bitcoin price of 7.600$, a 4MW powerdraw, and electricity prices of $0.08&#x2F;KWh<p>Miners controlling 51% would profit north of $1.000.000.000 yearly, and if they just want to be compensated for that one year, you have to pay $1.000.000.000 to rent 51%. That is a lot of money, and at $20.000 high it would be tripple that value.<p>However, why would 51% of the capacity suddenly exit? Rather they want to be compensated for multiple years of profit, lets say 5 years and it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect bitcoin to reach $70.000 in that time. So we&#x27;re looking at a $50.000.000.000 cost to coordinate the attack. That&#x27;s expensive, and with that kind of money there are other ways to make them multiply. Who would pay that to ensure destruction of the thing we know as Bitcoin? After all, the success means it&#x27;s likely that another *coin takes over, where you cannot 51% as easily."

"A control system is a feedback loop that connects measurements (orientation, speed, acceleration) and steering (grid fins orientation, engine power and gimbaling, RCS&#x2F;other means of attitude control) in order to steer the entire system into a desired state (in this case, upright orientation and 0m&#x2F;s velocity exactly at the point of touchdown). The control system measures the state of the rocket and <i>directly</i> adjusts the control inputs - i.e. it&#x27;s not a series of if-else instructions, but more like &quot;engine_gimbal_x = P * yaw + I * integral(yaw) + D * dyaw&#x2F;dt&quot;[0] - the inputs and outputs are wired together through a set of mathematical transformations.<p>The &quot;lag&quot; is a delay between your steering signal and the state of the system changing in response. In this case, because of static friction, valves controlling fuel flow reacted with delay (I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re talking about Merlin&#x27;s valves or attitude control engines though) - so the rocket did not react immediately after being told to do so.<p>There&#x27;s a whole math field around that topic, known as &quot;control theory&quot;. There are ways to determine the limits of inputs and outputs that will allow your control system to keep everything in the desired state. In this case however, the input lag wasn&#x27;t accounted for and it pushed the system out of the space of stable states, beyond the ranges where the control unit could keep up with the changes, so it ended up oversteering. Fortunately, in this case it&#x27;s mostly a software problem, i.e. they could tweak the controller to deal with the lag.<p>The best way to imagine it is to recall your first experiences with a bike or ice skates - trying to balance yourself on them is exactly the kind of thing the rocket was doing, probably with similar results.<p>My control theory is a bit rusty nowadays, but I hope this clears up some things.<p>[0] - if you ever hear about &quot;PID controller&quot;, this is exactly where the name comes from - proportional, integral, derivative."

Some processors expose performance counters but you don&#x27;t need to accurately measure memory bandwidth to know you are maxing out. Suppose you know that the memory bandwidth is 1Gb&#x2F;s and you program reads 100Gb of data to produce the result. If the execution takes ~100s then you know you hit the maximum memory bandwidth.
"&gt;So bandwidth plays a role<p>Of course it does, but we&#x27;re not talking 10Mb&#x2F;s networks here.  People stream 1080p content all the time, gigE can handle that no problem.  The only latency concern would be the encoding step, not transferring the data."

"We are not shipping all of the data as a whole to the gpu. We are going to be releasing some whitepapers that explain this in more detail but lets get a few things clear. Data is sent to the gpu compressed since it is compressed when it is stored. We can decompress VERY  quickly on GPU&#x27;s (30-50GB&#x2F;s is easily achievable on a K80) and because each of our columns are compressed using one of our cascading compression algorithms (which everyone offers the best in terms of compression and throughput). We are a column store and only send over the columns that are being used in processing. So for example<p>select id, name, age, avg(income) from people group by gender<p>In this case only the income and gender columns would actually be sent to the gpu and they would do so in a compressed fashion to increase the &quot;effective&quot; bandwidth of data over PCIE. Even more interesting is that id, name, and age, would be pulled from our horizontal store instead of our compressed columnar store in order to minimize the number of iops necessary to fill the result set."

Correct. Also for curiosity I did a test on my host and Mac VM. Program reported on both Windows and Mac VM same speed of ~500 MB&#x2F;s (which translates into 4.8 Gbps for OP style).

"Not sure what you mean.

Seeking in your &quot;index&quot; would take time too.<p>The only way to get good performance from DRAM is to always write data sequentially in the same order they will be read. Then you get full sequential throughput both for writing and reading and this is many GB&#x2F;s and keeps increasing with clock speed. But that&#x27;s a software optimization.<p>Otherwise caching is beneficial, but the cache has to be SRAM to have low random access latency. SRAM is physically larger and power hungry, half of a modern CPU is cache and it&#x27;s still only a few MB."

"I&#x27;ve noticed some combinations of mobile plans and high speeds from the towers are particularly bad.

Even full-speed 4G can theoretically drain a full gigabyte in under four minutes (quick Google shows companies promising up to 5MB&#x2F;s in some cases), so it can theoretically drain a lot of people&#x27;s full months in under an hour. Though I&#x27;m not sure if the network will actually let you do that continuously, if for no other reason than I&#x27;m sure they got tired of calls from people complaining about some app using up their full month&#x27;s quote in five minutes when they didn&#x27;t even know the app was running, etc."

"In late 2014 I replaced the disks in my 2008 Mac Pro at work and my 2009 Mac Pro at home with Samsung EVO 840 and 850 SSD disks. I kept track of accumulated writes.<p>Both machines were heavily used for development and consumer type stuff. No big data stuff or big media stuff.<p>Samsung rates these things at 150 TB write endurance for the 850 and something around 120 TB for the 840.<p>My projection based on that usage is that it will take over 35 years to reach 100 TB.<p>Samsung&#x27;s ratings are quite conservative. Reviewers that have put these things through write torture tests to the point of error have typically gotten several times Samsung&#x27;s rating.

My Samsung EVOs are now on the iMac in an AKiTiO Thunder3 Quad Mini enclosure.<p>The internal SSD in the iMac gets just short of 2000 MB&#x2F;s for both read and write, according to Disk Speed Test from Blackmagic Design.

"Do you really mean &quot;nondeterministic&quot;?

Even with eye tracking it&#x27;s still really a hack, and isn&#x27;t naturally responsive - it&#x27;s the software reacting to your gaze.<p>Display based accommodation however renders objects at different focal points. So when your eye changes gaze point and your ocular muscles respond to put your eye at that focus level, the object&#x2F;s come into focus.

"&gt; Somehow along the way the cable&#x2F;TV companies introduced latency in the channel changes and people just accepted it as the new normal.<p>The technical reason is that digital TV is a heavily compressed signal [1] (used to be MPEG2, perhaps they have moved on to h.264) with a GOP (group of pictures) length that is usually around 0.5-2 seconds. When you switch channels, the MPEG-2 decoder in your receiver needs to wait until a new GOP starts, because there is no meaningful way to decode a GOP that&#x27;s &quot;in progress&quot;.<p>[1] And the technical reason for the compression is that analog HD needs a lot more bandwidth than analog NTSC&#x2F;PAL&#x2F;SECAM, while raw HD transmission would need an absurd amount of bandwidth per channel (about a gigabit&#x2F;s for 1080p30). So HD television pretty much requires the use of digital compression. Efficient digital video compression requires GOP structures."

"If you&#x27;re talking about competing with Substack and focusing on food, and doing it right now, no. It will not work - yet. The fast growing generalist platform will frustrate you at this stage, it will consume all the oxygen in the room. The food blogs &amp; food lists will all try that first, possibly for several years, before finally becoming dissatisfied after a long duration experience; and with their experience with the product they will then look for something more narrowly fit, more specialized, to their food needs.<p>If the generalist platform&#x2F;s become very large (and the segment overall), then you can split off from them at some point down the road. The generalists are training a large userbase, which you can then seek to acquire - by giving them things Substack &amp; co can&#x27;t, such as further customizing to eg food - as they become dissatisfied. That training process is difficult and massively time consuming, it more often than not eats a small company alive (plainly you won&#x27;t tend to get enough of a userbase because the training process is so slow for any given niche to get big enough fast enough, meanwhile the giant generalist is booming). You first need mass adoption, mass understanding of the platform that Substack represents (mailing list &#x2F; newsletter + blog hybrid with optional subscription built in, or whatever the hell it is), which is what Substack is going to deliver. You need an ecosystem built out, after that you can build smaller, niche services that compete with Substack &amp; co. in particular areas like food.<p>Do I think that could work long-term? Sure, assuming the Substack segment gets large (which I think it will). If you do it now, prepare for a very slow, very long journey. Giant platforms are always candidates for spinning services out of, sites like Craigslist or Reddit are prime spawning ground for such. To the extent you move too early, is the extent to which you&#x27;ll suffer an unnecessarily long journey, and it&#x27;s likely that other competitors will arrive when the time is right for the niche break-out and you&#x27;ll have to fight with them anyway (and their service will be new; people like to use new, trendy Internet services like they do anything else in the physical world)."

"Instead of limiting my ability to enter contracts and chose the Internet&#x2F;streaming service I want, I would much rather they devise a methodology for measuring and enforcing connection performance.<p>For example, &quot;broadband internet&quot; means at least 50Mbit. &quot;50 Mbit&quot; means that 90% percent of the time, there is a sustained throughput of at least 5MB&#x2F;s for a TCP connection to a server in any data-center across the continental US (assuming the data-center link itself is not congested). &quot;Unmetered&quot; means that per month, the user can transfer a volume of data of at least 10% of the volume corresponding to a saturation of the connection 24&#x2F;7 (1300 GB for a 50 Mbit connection as defined above).<p>Under such a rule, Comcast&#x27;s connections could only be sold as &quot;Dial-up+&quot;. And if broadband is not available in an area it&#x27;s fair game for the municipal or state authorities to provision it with public funds as a basic need for a modern citizen; since the incumbent private provider obviously can&#x27;t get a return on it&#x27;s investment (what OTHER reason for not developing your infrastructure could there be, right ?)"

"The argument isn&#x27;t that 23MB&#x2F;s is so outrageously fast that it must be from a USB drive and couldn&#x27;t be from the internet. The argument is that 23 MB&#x2F;s is a peculiar number because it is so close to USB 2 max throughput (480Mbit in spec, but practically closer to 280Mbit due to bus access overhead and underlying storage limitations.) It&#x27;s not at all unreasonable to expect that a USB2 mass storage device would cap out around there for write speeds on a larger USB 2 flash drive.<p>What&#x27;s more relevant is the jitter on the timestamps. IF it was just an average of 23MB&#x2F;s, I&#x27;d agree with you. But what I suspect is that it&#x27;s sustained 23MB&#x2F;s with little variation.<p>Putting aside wild theories about the timestamps being intentionally modified to represent a USB transfer, a sustained 23MB&#x2F;s with no variation is awfully characteristic of a USB transfer."

"&gt; &quot;stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user&quot;<p>This seems like a very odd way of phrasing the law.

Therefore, could one argue that any site that includes the user agent in their logs would be violating this law?<p>And what if the user is not behind a NAT? In that case, the user&#x27;s external IP address is the one their terminal equipment places in the TCP header... which would mean that it is necessarily stored in said terminal equipment.

&gt; This is appalling.<p>Your &#x2F;s is (hopefully) missing.
"FYI, the cheapest PCIe SSD card I could find, a 240GB OCZ RevoDrive 3 will cost you ~$600 (while IOPs weren&#x27;t specified, a +1GB&#x2F;s RW was mentioned in the keynote).<p>As you mentioned, much of the cost is in the (extra) GPU (roughly FirePro W7000 class), but being said, I think you underestimate how important OpenCL is these days for video editing. FCPX is heavily dependent on the GPU and presumably Logic will be moving in that direction as well."
"This holds some potential for media playback as well, since matching display frame-rate to source material is usually necessary to avoid jerky playback (Some people are very sensitive to any kind of micro-stutter while others don&#x27;t seem to notice). Of course, playback software will have to support it (easy) and it may be a while before HDTV&#x27;s or projectors include Nvidia&#x27;s chip, if that even happens at all!  However, if it does happen, this will effectively signal the end of adjusting frame-rate on displays.  Even simply allowing higher refresh rates than 60 Hz could clear up a lot of problems.<p>I don&#x27;t think Displayport has sufficient bandwidth for 4K video at 144 Hz unfortunately. An upgrade on Displayport may be necessary. Given that HDCP has proven to be utterly pointless, one would hope DRM gets the boot.  Encrypting and decrypting data at over 20 Gbit&#x2F;s is probably a PITA when you&#x27;re aiming for low latency and low cost."
"The solution is to curb development in countries like India.

"Advertised speed usually means it&#x27;s technically possible, even if it doesn&#x27;t happen in practice.

But even 100Mb&#x2F;s is good enough connectivity in my experience with fiber and apparently that&#x27;s common for FTTC deployments."
"A $850 CPU (Threadripper 2950x) will give you Hundreds of GFlops with ~100GB&#x2F;s bandwidth to main memory.<p>A $700 GPU (AMD Radeon VII) will give you 13.8 TFlops with 1TB&#x2F;s bandwidth to video memory.<p>If you have a workload that lends itself to GPU programming, then you should buy a 2nd GPU (or 3rd, or 4th GPU) and stick it into your system. Not all workloads work on a GPU, but a LOT of workloads just make more sense on a GPU.<p>&gt; But you are right that any time you turn to SIMD, you might be able to turn to the GPU and get a much biggger win.<p>As long as the problem is big enough to mitigate the PCIe latency, kernel startup time, and PCIe bandwidth. Transferring data is relatively slow (PCIe x16 == 15GB&#x2F;s).<p>There are many algorithms which are faster to execute on the CPU, because executing out of L1 cache is faster than waiting for the PCIe bus. In these cases, you should prefer CPU-side SIMD, to keep the data &quot;hot&quot; in L1 cache."

"Off by a few orders of magnitude. Tihane-2 hit 33 pflops or 3.3*10^16 flops or approx 1&#x2F;3 of the upper bound. Brain simulation is a snag, but it isn&#x27;t our only snag.<p>Like you said, it&#x27;s a general algorithm issue. We do not remotely understand the brain well enough to simulate it. We have very little idea of what an intelligent algorithm (other than brain sim) would look like.<p>Also, all of these estimates are based on flops and none of them consider bandwidth. We are a few orders of magnitude lower in gigabits&#x2F;s than we are in flops. I personally think that is where the bottleneck is. 100 billion neurons with a 100 gigabit&#x2F;second pipe could interact once per second and then only at the level of a toggle switch. Granted not all neurons have to interact with one another, but we are significantly behind in bandwidth and structural organization.<p>Bandwidth is intimately tied to processing capacity. I dont think the bandwidth will be there until 2045-2065 and like you say we have serious software&#x2F;algorithm&#x2F;understanding deficiencies to resolve before then. I would be very surprised if we get general AI before 2065 if ever. I do not expect it in my lifetime and would be pleasantly surprised if it happened."

"&gt; but most broadcasters choose to continue regular FM simulcast and subdivide the remaining digital bandwidth across multiple virtual channels.<p>The FCC has not approved all-digital modes yet.  Further,  we cannot control the bitrate of the &quot;main&quot; digital simulcast.  We _can_ control the sub-channels,  but it doesn&#x27;t matter how much bandwidth you throw at it,  the HDC codec (which is a bastardized form of HE-AAC) always sounds like garbage.  This is partially owing to the codec,  but also to the fact that we only have 96kbit&#x2F;s in total to allocate to all sub-channels."
"&quot;So...show me facts? Or some sort of reasoning?&quot;<p>...<p>I&#x27;ve done nothing but that everywhere in this thread; and I&#x27;m the only one doing it, too. Maybe Wikipedia isn&#x27;t serious enough for you; sorry that I didn&#x27;t copy and paste the references at the bottom of the Wikipedia page as more &#x27;authoritative&#x27;. But maybe Wikipedia is in on it, of course; it&#x27;s well known to be a bastion of nut cases who are in bed with the Big Weapons lobby (&#x2F;s, just to be sure). But feel free to point out any factual inaccuracies you find.<p>&quot;We were talking about developed nations.&quot;<p>Sure, a criterion which you are reducing to &#x27;GDP&#x27;, because otherwise you can&#x27;t end up with Western Europe only (OK, plus Australia). Which is a silly criterion, as evidenced by those economists and social scientists making different metrics, such as the human development index. And let that be exactly what I&#x27;ve referenced above! I seem to know much better than you what this term means, whereas you conveniently ignore half of what I&#x27;m writing.<p>&quot;take it up with the UN or the CIA or whoever&quot;<p>Many government organizations use &#x27;developed nation&#x27; in a very specific, economic way; which essentially boils down to &#x27;per capita income &gt; some cutoff&#x27;. And as a metric for some economic behaviors or classification for regression analysis, this makes sense. But this is not the sort of &#x27;developed&#x27; that matters in this discussion.<p>&quot;If you think there&#x27;s a racial component to &quot;developed nations,&quot;&quot;<p>OK, I&#x27;ve conceded before that that was a poor choice of words and I&#x27;ve replaced &#x27;racist&#x27; with &#x27;xenophobic&#x27;; it was not the objective to make this into a debate on how exactly to define racism in this context. That being said, I still don&#x27;t see how you can explain your peculiar definition of &#x27;developed&#x27; as anything else than &#x27;racist&#x27;. I mean, having minimum sentences for crack (a &#x27;black&#x27; drug) three times higher than those for cocaine (a &#x27;white&#x27; drug) is racist; how is cherry picking a bunch of countries so that they&#x27;re all conveniently predominantly white and then saying that all &#x27;those others&#x27; are such a bunch of barbaric sub humans that they can&#x27;t even be expected to not murder each other all day every day be construed as anything but &#x27;racist&#x27;?<p>I know that you didn&#x27;t use those words, and I don&#x27;t even think you actually think that way (I mean, no sane person could think that way). That&#x27;s why I said &#x27;borderline&#x27; - because the underlying correlation there is clear, even if there any many ways to rationalize it away (because, surely, crack is more dangerous than powder cocaine, and redlining is not racist because hey our data shows that neighborhoods x, y and z have higher default rates - again, &#x2F;s just to be sure)."

"The beam’s horizontal motion speed goes down linearly with height if the beam is sent from a fixed location.<p>So, picking 30,000 feet for flight height and 250m&#x2F;s for the plane’s speed, at 900 feet the beam’s speed would be 7½ m&#x2F;s. That’s quite doable for birds.<p>More importantly, if the beam isn’t sent from directly below the plane, and the plane flies more or less directly towards or away from the beam’s source, the speed at which it moves horizontally goes down considerably (1&#x2F;cos(α), where α is the deviation from the vertical, I think), and its width when flying through it in the direction of the beam’s source at constant height will go up considerably.<p>The beam’s width, and, with it, intensity, will likely be larger on the ground, but my gut feeling is this won’t be enough to correct for both these factors in all cases (corrections welcome)"

Sure, without the friction of the rails and the air you save energy, and maybe you can build the whole thing cheaper, and that&#x27;s lovely and all.<p>But wasn&#x27;t the ambition to go much faster than a train? I thought this was about reaching speeds of airplanes...<p>If we are at speeds around or below 200 mph when the pods are full, SF - LA would still take a couple of hours. A French wheeled TGV could have done that 35 years ago. A Japanese wheeled Shinkansen could have done that even before. A Japanese or Chinese maglev version of the last 1-2 decades could easily beat that. And that&#x27;s without being stuck in a dumb tube. By the time the hyperloop becomes a reality, if ever, there will be tens of thousands of miles of high speed rails around the world.<p>The hyperloop is a sizeable amount of current hype and a future loop with pods that barely match yesterday&#x27;s high speed trains. These high speed trains, engineering wonders that actually exist, don&#x27;t receive any attention in press. I&#x27;d say that the hyperloop has been remarkably good at sucking the air out of the room."
"The OrangePis have much better IO (with the exception of the OrangePi+ 2, which is a bad buy), with each USB port being direct wired &amp; capable of 40MB&#x2F;s, and an onboard 100mbps PHY.

"It&#x27;s not about RH packages directly. They are fine. As it is with universe on ubuntu, you quite likely need epel on rhel for doing quite a lot of basic stuff.

The convergence depends on the Courant number, which basically says that the grid step dx must be c*dt, i.e. the sound must travel on grid step per one time step.

Tanks are usually the biggest parts by mass in an orbital rocket - and they scale down rather well, to a certain limit. Engines, however, could scale worse. That will affect your mass ratio, and at some point your payload will become zero.<p>This is the main problem with current state of the art in high power rocketry (if you want to launch a satellite, you have to have more than 8 km&#x2F;s delta-V, and this is enough to qualify it as a high power rocketry).

But engines, valves - you&#x27;ll have to have valves - and, after some point, tanks (because you can&#x27;t have too thin of a wall without breaking in a real flight) will stop scaling. You&#x27;ll likely find that it&#x27;s about the same mass of a rocket which can launch 1&#x2F;4 kg to orbit or 1 kg to orbit.<p>Elon Mask proved that $90 millions are enough to build a half-a-ton payload rocket from scratch. May be - may be - $1 million is enough to build and launch a smallest rocket from scratch. Hard to say... but it&#x27;s definitely more than $100 thousands today."

"It&#x27;s basically normal unless you are paying for a guaranteed SLA.  Small hosting providers either have none or have one that just credits you for the time you were down, which is usually not much (an hour is 1&#x2F;720th of your monthly fee).<p>Most technology is simply unreliable.  Unless you pay a lot more for redundant systems.  My internet provider here in NYC, Time Warner Cable, has had 3 outages in 3 weeks, two being a full day in my neighborhood.  And that&#x27;s on a $100&#x2F;month 50 MB&#x2F;s down and 5 MB&#x2F;s up connection, the most expensive one they offer to the home.  Unfortunately, like a lot of the US, Time Warner&#x27;s infrastructure is horribly outdated, so these issues occur regularly.  And, as with much of the US, we don&#x27;t have any other options.  Neither of the other cable providers service us.  Verizon&#x27;s FiOS rollout was abandoned.  We can get DSL, but it&#x27;s horribly slow (under 1MB&#x2F;s up) and is notoriously reliable (when I tried it years back, it was down 8 days out of my 30 day trial period because a Verizon tech &#x27;plugged something in wrong in our street&#x27;s box&#x27;).  So, I have to pay for a Verizon hotspot as a backup so I can &#x27;reliably&#x27; work from home.  Of course, the 1st of the 3 most recent outages Time Warner had, Verizon&#x27;s LTE network went down at the same time.<p>So, yeah, that&#x27;s the &#x27;normal&#x27; of technology in the largest city in the United States."

Way back in school I had 2400 baud. Now THAT was slow.<p>Best to have a remote machine on a good network, that you ssh to for anything that needs high bandwidth.

"As long as you&#x27;re using at least a 100Mb&#x2F;s network (We use GbE), you should see a smooth experience. All works just as well as using a local machine, give or take some frames here and there. Just a forewarning, stay away from Google Chrome, and Chromium. They are awful to use with LTSP, you must deploy them as local apps as a fat-thin client solution, which isn&#x27;t compatible with the Pi. The reasoning for this is that Chrome makes too many calls to the X server, and this causes horrible performance, you&#x27;ll literally be watching chrome refresh, like loading an image over dialup."

"I appear to have exaggerated slightly when I said <i>several</i> orders of magnitude, but the original 3D XPoint latency numbers put it at about 25 times higher latencies than contemporary DRAM (~7000ns vs. ~200ns).<p>Likewise, quad-channel DDR4 setups can push around 60GB&#x2F;s, while Optane PCIe SSD&#x27;s have only been able to push around 2GB&#x2F;s. The PCIe x4 interfaces that they use should have been able to push 4GB&#x2F;s, and if they started hitting a wall there, they could just have used a full PCIe x16 interface which could push around 15GB&#x2F;s. This indicates that the throughput was not interface bound.<p>Nothing seems to signal that Intel have have anything up their sleeve to provide the 25x latency improvement and 30x throughput improvement needed to just be even with DRAM, although placing the chips on the memory bus will of course provide <i>some</i> speedup."
"As a dev you should take a look at the difference of hashes&#x2F;s of the different algorithms. Some are measured in GH&#x2F;s, some in MH&#x2F;s, some only kH&#x2F;s. E.g. MD5 is way faster then SHA256. So if you only use a strong hash for ensuring data integrity in the absence of adversaries and performance matters, you may prefer MD5 even in these days."
"The 10k problem is still not solved. A run of the mill VPS typically manages around 1k simultaneous connections and 10k requests&#x2F;s. That is, over plain http. Over TLS this goes down to about 100 connections and 600 requests&#x2F;s. A cheap amazon instance will usually be around 1&#x2F;5th of all that.<p>With a bit of tweaking you can get the plain http case a bit higher, but the TLS route will not get much better, because TLS isn&#x27;t written with speed in mind (the handshake is slow and expensive) and the prevalent implementation (OpenSSL) is not written for high performance servers (it basically dictates that you run blocking sockets in a thread per connection).<p>Unfortunately spdy and various http2 proposals rely on TLS (in order to punch trough proxies), which means going back in server performance about 10 years.<p>So it is of little surprise that companies have started offering &quot;cloud&quot; solutions, because the typical VPS can&#x27;t handle todays high traffic internet over TLS (worse than plain http by a factor of 10) and the typical cloud server is worse than a VPS by a factor 5, creating a 50x performance degradation, artificially. Obviously when faced with the question of running 10 servers, or 100, most small companies turn to the even worse &quot;cloud&quot; solution, requiring even more servers (500).<p>The whole affair is a sodding mess, and we&#x27;re wasting massive amounts of energy and capital on insisting on doing things inefficiently. This is because by rights our VPS servers should easily be able to break trough the 10k limit in every way, but it can&#x27;t because the OS wastes a lot of time running an inefficient network stack as well as that TLS and OpenSSL can&#x27;t be bothered to get their act together.<p>And that is how, in the year of our lord 2014, more than 15 years after somebody writing the 10k problem article, and after webservers becoming at least 128x faster then back in the 90ties, most websites out there can still not stand up to serious traffic, take ages to load, and are hosted by an infrastructure (routers and whatnot) that easily buckle under even light DDOSing."

"Correct, good parsing benchmarks will ensure the input is in memory or, at least, heavily cached with a linear access pattern.

"Yes, not using cache at all would make everything very slow. I&#x27;m now of course talking about using in session memory cache. If it&#x27;s too small you can reconfigure it using browser.cache.memory.capacity parameter with Firefox. With fiber I never use caching. But yes, with 512kbit&#x2F;s connection I unfortunately had to use disk caching too, to avoid re-downloading anything I simply could. But of course in that kind of situation and configurate you&#x27;re really aware that you&#x27;re not destroying all data between sessions. For privacy virtual machine with hardened configuration + tor is good idea. Otherwise there&#x27;s no reasonable expectation of privacy anyway, as they&#x27;re saying. In technical terms, there are so many ways to track users who do not harden those, that there&#x27;s no reason to expect any privacy. As we have seen with all these NSA discussions, all technical options were pre-known already. You don&#x27;t know if sites use some techniques or not, but it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that they do use at least all publicly known techniques. And possibly some unknown. So making attack (or tracking) surface as small as possible, when looking for privacy is reasonable. Maintaining any data between sessions is just stupid if you&#x27;re looking for privacy. Always boot clean virtual machine, which is similar to other virtual machines, is best approach. Otherwise there are tons of things they can do to track you.<p>Btw. even if browser keeps cache, you can always clear storage paths.<p>One of things that doesn&#x27;t seem to be known to many users is that many databases contain deleted data (marked free) for long time. They just don&#x27;t think about it. Just go through all files stored by browser, you&#x27;ll end up finding stuff that you woulnd&#x27;t expect to be there, if you&#x27;re naive. Right attitude is to expect everything to be stored always, and take proper care to destroy data when it&#x27;s required. This is just like the issue with SSD drives. If you write something on drive, you wan&#x27;t to destroy. There&#x27;s no sure way to destroy the data from drive, without totally physically destroying the drive. You simply don&#x27;t know, if the controller has written data to cell XYZ, and then re-mapped XYZ to somewhere else. Just overwrite it approach does not work in this case. And you can&#x27;t even guarantee that the manufacturer tool could properly erase that cell.<p>Just final words.

I couldn&#x27;t manage to get convolutions achieve the same perf as with CUDA cause with Vulkan I had to use a &quot;pull&quot; algorithm (read from all points in the window, write to one point), but that just performed way worse than the &quot;push&quot; algorithms that are possible to implement with CUDA (maintain a shared memory cache where you write, and as you read one value from the window, write its contribution to multiple locations, then do a full cache write to global memory). In numbers, I went from ~150 Gb&#x2F;s throughput with Vulkan to ~700Gb&#x2F;s with CUDA.<p>I think maybe Vulkan&#x2F;SPIRV could benefit from better compilers that take the &quot;pull&quot; algorithm and compile it to a &quot;push&quot; one using shared memory, but you are then at the mercy of the compiler for a 4x perf diff.<p>I think that if I have a rendering pipeline in which I want to integrate some compute, then wgpu&#x2F;Vulkan are great, particularly because chances are that the compute you need is per &quot;vertex&#x2F;pixel&#x2F;...&quot; kind of naive-massively-parallel kind of compute. But if I just have a raw compute pipeline, then it feels like using the wrong tool for the job."

"&gt; Most places have no outbound port restrictions, or when they do they usually always have a proxy for traffic to go out (like https for updates etc)<p>Depends which company. For companies that really care about security, letting arbitrary traffic out is a big no-no. Even via proxy, it requires tight controls.<p>We&#x27;ve had potential users that were quite excited that Prometheus works the other way, as their network security team were likely to permit it.<p>&gt; There is a reason why distributed systems exist and that is to scale efficiently with some degree of redundancy baked in.<p>The efficiency here is in humans (in theory anyway), not in resources or reliability. Distributed systems are a very hard problem, and we avoid those approaches for Prometheus as it&#x27;s a critical monitoring system. 
CP systems like Kafka and Zookeeper are not things you want on your alerting path, as they&#x27;ll fall apart when your network does. Prometheus will keep chugging along.<p>&gt; Single node HA is probably the most inefficient method of scaling.<p>I&#x27;d disagree, the standard approach these days tends to be a cluster of three which&#x27;d use at least 50% more resources.<p>&gt; It sounds like Prometheus needs to run properly on a single box for simplicity but over time needs to be broken up and made scalable beyond the bounds of a single server.<p>That&#x27;s correct. If you manage to have enough targets inside a single datacenter (many thousands of machines), then we recommend vertical sharding first and only if that doesn&#x27;t work horizontal sharding. Prometheus is really easy to run, so you&#x27;ll likely end up for organisation reasons choosing to vertically sharding anyway so that each team can control their own decentralised monitoring.<p>&gt; We didn&#x27;t want lots of individual consoles.<p>With Grafana you can view things across many Prometheus servers.<p>&gt; We wanted a central large system that could hold years of historical data,<p>Prometheus explicitly doesn&#x27;t do historical data. As we&#x27;re effectively talking unbounded amounts of storage that can&#x27;t fit on one machine, which implies a distributed storage system. As mentioned above that&#x27;s not something we want in our core for reliability.<p>The chosen approach is that we&#x27;ll interface with something else such as OpenTSDB that&#x27;ll do the long term storage, and we&#x27;ll support seamlessly graphing across it. That&#x27;s much easier to make reliable (just add a timeout), and if it does go down you&#x27;d still have the last few weeks of data sitting on the Prometheus box.<p>&gt; as well as allowing people to query it in real time<p>That we do really well, PromQL is very powerful and anything you can graph you can also alert on.<p>&gt; and we liked the idea of not needing to double up on hardware costs.<p>I feel this is a bit of a red herring. The question isn&#x27;t whether there&#x27;s a 2X multiplier in the math, it&#x27;s the overall cost as compared to the benefits.<p>Prometheus is astoundingly efficient, the latest numbers are 800k samples&#x2F;s on one machine. I haven&#x27;t heard of anything else that is even close, and I believe we&#x27;re also holding the record on storage efficiency.<p>Even 10X that cost isn&#x27;t likely to break the bank, so I&#x27;d suggest taking a look at the full range of features it offers and comparing to the real world cost. The operational aspects you mention are generally manageable, and if they aren&#x27;t your infrastructure likely has bigger problems."

"You sound exactly like their target market, too! &#x2F;s"
"A circular track means you&#x27;d have to accelerate the vehicle inward proportional to the square of the velocity.<p>If target exit velocity is 11 km&#x2F;s, and the acceleration of the straight portion of the track is insignificant compared to the circular portion, in order for the combined linear and centripetal accelerations to stay under 3G, I&#x27;d make each component 20.8 m&#x2F;s^2.<p>So if 20.8 m&#x2F;s^2 = (11000 m&#x2F;s)^2&#x2F;r, then r has to be 5800 km.  Closing the ring at that radius makes the circumference larger than the distance needed for a linear track.<p>Untrained humans could not ride it up to Earth-escape velocity.  LEO only needs about 8 km&#x2F;s.  So that requires a radius of 20.8 m&#x2F;s^2 = (8000 m&#x2F;s)^2&#x2F;r, 3000 km.  Still too big.<p>What if we bump the G threshold to 5G?  Then centripetal portion of the acceleration should top out at 34.7 m&#x2F;s^2, and required radius drops to 1850 km.<p>Okay, cargo only then, just to LEO.  25G max acceleration, 8000 m&#x2F;s exit velocity.  Radius 370 km, circumference 2300 km.  Still more track than needed by a linear launcher.<p>It&#x27;s always cheapest to put all the acceleration towards moving the vehicle in the direction you want it to go, instead of wasting some energy pushing it in different directions that ultimately cancel out.<p>You could use a spiral track, but the final leg of the spiral is going to have an effective radius so large it might as well just be straight the whole way."

There&#x27;s also atmospheric drag, the resistance of the atmosphere to your rocket when it&#x27;s traveling up to space.  The faster you accelerate the less gravity drag but the more atmospheric drag you experience since you spend less time accelerating but are traveling faster lower in the atmosphere, and drag is proportional to the square of the velocity.<p>As you can see, using an electromagnetic cannon where you are at full speed leaving the barrel of the gun, you will have zero gravity drag but an immense amount of atmospheric drag. This means both that you will have to apply much more deltaV and that the heating caused by the passage of your capsule through the atmosphere will be enough to destroy any known material.<p>Finally, if you launch at full velocity from the surface of the Earth then the rules of orbital mechanics mean that, if you are going into an elliptical orbit, your orbit will intersect the launch point eventually and your capsule will lithobrake on the ground, also destroying it.<p>Neither of these problems apply to launching from the Moon back to Earth, for the record.  The moon has no atmosphere to apply drag and heating.  And if you&#x27;re leaving the Moon&#x27;s orbit for Earth you&#x27;re on a hyperbolic orbit rather than an elliptical one and won&#x27;t be coming back around in any case.  So for getting off of airless Moons into orbit around their primary electromagnetic launchers are an excellent idea."

"It took me a while, but I believe this might be one of the few times that a stacked line chart would better serve the purpose.  Total throughput is the addition of the 5 &quot;per-connection throughputs.&quot;  Thus, during the peak, we see ~2 Gb&#x2F;s for all 5 servers, totaling ~10 Gbps.  In the top graph, we see 1-3 Gbps for the 5 servers, totally ~10 Gbps.  It would be more clear if a &quot;total throughput&quot; line were added or the author used a stacked line chart, since we&#x27;re looking at both total throughput and fairness."

"Of course it&#x27;s a bit of an apples to oranges comparison.<p>An interesting question about CRCs is whether you can implement them efficiently. CRC32 is possible with some help from the CPU (CLMUL as mentioned, or complete instructions for specific polynomials, like crc32c); eg. on Haswell you get to 14-16 GB&#x2F;s with a CLMUL approach on CRC32. That&#x27;s obviously much faster than the hashes I mentioned. With the zlib implementation, on the other hand, you only get about one GB&#x2F;s and there it&#x27;s really close to B2b already.<p>Table-based approaches (classic zlib implementation, or slice-by-n, which needs n-times as many tables) would not work well with longer polynomials; the tables would outgrow L1&#x2F;L2 cache sizes rather quickly. I&#x27;d have to think a bit about the tableless CLMUL approach."

So if you have 700 satellites up in the air given full spectrum that means they&#x27;d have a fixed limit of 10TBit&#x2F;s.  That can be divided between their users (but it won&#x27;t be anything close to 10TBit&#x2F;s).<p>So this will really be a factor of how big their beams are, how many people are within their beams, and how much frequency they can legally use.  While this is really cool and possible, I doubt this will open up a whole new internet in it&#x27;s first pass.<p>There is also the issue with, how are they going to get the signal to it&#x27;s destination?  They can&#x27;t beam it all the way around the world for you, and from what I understand at least OneWeb isn&#x27;t going to communicate from satellite to satellite.  So they&#x27;ll have to have a ton of ground stations to receive your link and then send it over fiber, or transmit up to GEO, then down again.   OR they&#x27;ll have to hop up and down between nodes to it&#x27;s destination, in a similar fashion to TOR.  I don&#x27;t know how they plan to solve this or if SpaceX has a better solution."

"There are more compiler bugs than many ever think. From mainframe COBOL compilers to gcc, I have encountered bugs in programs that were a result of what the compiler did.<p>The original source code did nothing special - it was simple code and due to specific optimisations that the compiler performed, inexplicable seemingly random errors would arise. One would have to constrain the optimisations the compiler would do to get the code to execute correctly.<p>No compiler is bug free. The bugs can manifest in strange ways and sometimes they will manifest only on specific kinds of data (edge case data).<p>Certainly there are many programs that are written incorrectly and give rise to apparently inexplicable errors that are due to misunderstood language features or specified compiler limits.<p>However, there are also many programs that do not have such source code errors that end up being rewritten in some way to avoid compiler based errors.<p>The worst I have seen is when dummy statements have to be put in to the source code in order to get the program to work correctly. I have seen compilers change the precision of numbers from one version to the next and you have to add additional code to restrict those numbers back to the specified range. I have seen compilers allocate multiple i&#x2F;o buffers as an optimisation that causes a program to fail when a single i&#x2F;o buffer allocation works fine - one has to turn off the optimisation - no documentation available as to how the compiler generated code uses those buffers.<p>All I can say is that it takes a fair amount of investigation to determine what kind of bug it is when it is subtle and randomly occurring. It can be everything from errors in the source to errors in the libraries to errors in code generation to errors in the o&#x2F;s (including driver errors or memory errors).<p>Anyone who blanket says the compiler is not to blame is living in a rose coloured glasses world. Compilers are complex programs and the source code for them can be just as wrong as for any other program. The code generated for compilers can be just as bug ridden as any other program."

"&gt; It’s trivial to limit number of created documents in postgres, couchdb or application server though validation, I’m talking about updating document not creating new. In posgres if I update 1mb document used space will not always grow. In couch db situation is different. In case of relation db you have application server with custom logic and validations, couchdb from other side is accessible from outsize.<p>It is? It&#x27;s unclear to me why I&#x27;m allowing 10 updates to a (largish, 10MB! Use a file or store it in S3!) document per-minute, but not 10 creates. Maybe I&#x27;m building Google Docs? Except I&#x27;d want old revisions, so those are creates. Plus 10 Mb is a huge spreadsheet. But sure lets roll with it. Actually Couch does <i>not</i> keep old versions of documents around, only old revision numbers. When a document is updated, the old version becomes eligible for compaction (basically garbage collection). So your attacker has to be fast enough to outrun the compactor, while being slow enough to not get temporarily banned from your service. It seems like less effort to me to use this power to flood your network I&#x2F;O, which is almost certainly lower than your disk I&#x2F;O. Or just choke your Postgres server on it&#x27;s 100Mb&#x2F;s disk I&#x2F;O for updates + whatever is required to maintain your indexes.<p>I&#x27;m not actually advocating for Couch over Postgres. In my mind Postgres should be the default choice, and you switch to something else if you have a reason. For Couch, the biggest reason is sync is built in, in such a way that you can leverage it for your own applications with minimal effort. In my experience sync can be devilishly hard for non-trivial cases, so depending on your app, that can be pretty compelling.<p>But so far you seem to be focused on DOS attacks your not going to find separate advice for Postgres vs Mongo vs Couch, because the backing system doesn&#x27;t matter. The attacks and mitigations are identical no matter the back-end, namely stop the traffic before it consumes your resources."

"If orbital mechanics were this unstable, we wouldn&#x27;t ever manage to have any sattellites up in orbit around the Earth (or have the Earth orbit the Sun, and the Sun orbit the centre of the galaxy..). The important part of your orbit is the sideways velocity (For example, the International Space Station orbits at around 27,600 km&#x2F;h). Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re launched from the ISS (and that the ISS&#x27;s orbit is perfectly circular), straight down towards the Earth at about 30km&#x2F;s. Initially, you&#x27;ll get closer to the Earth, but at the same time your orbital velocity will increase as you&#x27;re going down, which eventually ends up sending you back up to the same orbit as the ISS (although I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ll end up ahead of the ISS, behind it or right back at it). You&#x27;ll have an upwards speed of 30km&#x2F;s, and will keep going up at a decreasing speed until you hit some maximum point, and start coming back down to repeat the cycle. Your orbital path will end up tracing out an ellipse, and at no point will you spiral in or away.<p>Ultimately, to actually come back down to Earth you have to burn off a lot of sideways speed (especially if you don&#x27;t want to be going too fast when you enter the atmosphere). And, to leave Earth&#x27;s gravity, it takes quite a lot of acceleration too."

"The comparison to Netflix is ridiculous. Netflix being awesome is not a function of centralized being better than decentralized, it&#x27;s a function of torrented content being illegal 99&#x2F;100 times and thus it&#x27;s very tricky to commercialize it, apart from (shady) ad networks that accept the mere indexing of torrent links.<p>But consider for a moment the popularity of Popcorn time or torrents in general. They&#x27;re massively popular despite the fact everyone knows it&#x27;s illegal and knows many countries have histories of punishing illegal downloaders, let alone the big uploaders. And it&#x27;s not just that they&#x27;re popular, they work really, really well for something completely free.<p>Does that mean we prefer using commercial solutions most of the time? It depends. Torrenting tech is monetized through ads but kept free, just like things like gmail or facebook. The difference is that gmail isn&#x27;t illegal and thus can get venture capital investments, partnerships, build elaborate products (like gmail for business) that interface with online identities (like businesses, phone security) and infrastructures (banking &amp; payment processing infrastructure), have customer service etc. While most torrenting services have to operate in the dark, anonymously, outside of infrastructure, with few partnerships, little investment etc.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think we should try to reason from analogy here. Centralized&#x2F;decentralized doesn&#x27;t inherently predict anything.<p>I think at the end of the day we have to look at the &#x27;per person&#x27; scale. The average US citizen makes 2 transactions a day (one of the metrics I saw used in this slideshow, too.) The average bitcoin transaction is 500 bytes. For a global citizen it&#x27;s likely slightly less than 2 on average considering the US one of the most consumerist societies, but let&#x27;s say 2 for everyone.<p>Alright so 1 kilobyte of data per day for everyone in the world.<p>Is that a big deal? No. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s still 14 TB of data, daily, but it&#x27;s manageable.<p>It requires an 82 mb&#x2F;s connection to handle that much data. That&#x27;s for the entire world populations (1 month old babies included!) to average as many transactions as the average US citizen.<p>Just put that into perspective. We&#x27;re not talking about this kind of technology today, bitcoin has only a few million users. It&#x27;s unlikely bitcoin will ever become popular enough to service 7 billion people in the first place, the internet&#x27;s been around for decades and it&#x27;s not even close, hell electricity or clean water doesn&#x27;t even do that. But hypothetically if it happened, we&#x27;d be talking about some date that&#x27;s at LEAST 20 years out from now to get to 7 billion and that in itself is already extremely optimistic. For perspective, it took the internet nearly 2 decades to get to 2 billion internet users.<p>So to say a 82 mb&#x2F;s internet connection in 2035 is too big of a deal for what is likely going to be a node run by a professional business like Coinbase. (i.e. I believe bitcoin&#x27;s infrastructure will be run more and more by professional businesses rather than home desktop PCs, but these businesses will exist in every country on the planet and be decentralized a bit like how ISPs are decentralized only much more because running a node isn&#x27;t nearly as big a deal obviously, as it&#x27;s one of many things running on the ISP&#x27;s network).<p>Average home internet is about 5 megabytes per second today in OECD countries. And we know bandwidth, like CPU and storage, has grown roughly 50-60% in the past decades and it&#x27;s likely to average something close to that (like 40-50%) in the next few decades. 50% yoy would be 3300x in 20 years. 5 MB&#x2F;S would be 15 gb&#x2F;s by 2035. Optimistic? Absolutely, it&#x27;s the most optimistic metric based on past data. But let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s extremely likely that reaching 1 gigabyte per second will easily happen by the time a bitcoin node needs 0.082 gigabytes per second. And that&#x27;s for a standard, average, consumer, home connection. NOT the much better industrial connections that you expect bitcoin nodes will be hooked into by 2035 (if it indeed is so important that 7 billion people use it for 2 transactions a day).<p>In short, 1 kilobyte of data per person is so little that whether it&#x27;s centralized or decentralized it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much. It can be dealt with. Especially when you consider that many of these transactions can happen off-chain, on sidechains, treechains, less secure chains (e.g. to buy coffee or make a 1 cent payment to read a New York Times article automatically instead of being served a 10 second advertisement with a 1 cent revenue per view value, these transactions can happen on less secure channels).<p>Decentralized&#x2F;centralized is an interesting discussion, sure, but at the 1 kilobyte per day per person scale, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very relevant when it comes to technical scalability. It&#x27;s relevant for other reasons definitely (like a decentralized digital global banking system being much less prone to anti-competitive banking monopolies and licensing than say a centralized one like Paypal) but I don&#x27;t think technical scalability is the biggest problem.<p>Beyond that bitcoin is so nascent and small... I mean I quite like it and think it just might win, but I still feel it&#x27;s a bit silly to talk about whether bitcoin can scale to a billion users all the time, when its growth rates are really not all that impressive. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong, scalability is important to talk about, but it commands such a disproportionate amount of talk. It&#x27;s like wondering if 50% of the Mars debate was about whether Mars can support a city of a million humans, let&#x27;s see if we can get 20 people living there first you know?"
"At Google my colleague developed a simple test that made vibration effects very obvious (this was in 2008). In a server with a bunch of disks, do random reads or writes on all but one disk. On the final disk, do sequential reads. Back then you could get on the order of 100MB&#x2F;s sequential read speed on the outer edge of a hard drive in ideal conditions. Under this test performance would dive to something like 10MB&#x2F;s or worse. All of the seeking would cause vibration, which caused misreads on the disk under test. When a bad read happens a hard drive has to wait until the next rotation to try again. We eventually fixed this with better damping."

NOR flash is usually SLC and will take 100k writes&#x2F;erases and is quite simple to access (as compared to MLC NAND which only usually takes 3k erases and is a pain to access comparatively due to things like ECC requirement).<p>SPI flash generally will do on the order of 0.5 MB&#x2F;s erases, slightly faster writes, and somewhere in the realm of 4 to 12 MB&#x2F;s reads, give or take.  It&#x27;s not high performance but it&#x27;s simple, cheap, and low pin-count.  The host controller is responsible for wear leveling, erasing each needed sector&#x2F;block, and all writes, as SPI flash is unmanaged (compared to SD cards which are managed memory)."

"If you read your own results with care you will notice that your results also show that fastest brotli is faster than fastest zstd. Your results also show that brotli compresses more than zstd at higher settings, even if you turn off the static dictionary of brotli.<p>If you are interested at zstd 0.7.1 -22, you can reach the same compression density with brotli 0.4.0 at quality setting -7 (at least for this file with the static dictionary). Then you are comparing a brotli&#x27;s compression speed of 57 MB&#x2F;s to zstd&#x27;s 4.01 MB&#x2F;s. Brotli is 14x faster at this compression density.<p>For decompress-once roundtrip at this density, brotli achieves 53 MB&#x2F;s, and zstd 4 MB&#x2F;s. Brotli&#x27;s roundtrip is 13x faster.<p>In decompression brotli is 2x slower on Intel, but decompression times at 800+ MB&#x2F;s are going to be negligible in most use (think &lt; 1 % of cycles in your datacenter), if the data is parsed&#x2F;processed somehow afterwards.<p>Brotli&#x27;s entropy encoding is simpler (no 64-bit operations), and because of this on 32 bit arm the decompression speeds of zstd and brotli are about the same.<p>I acknowledge that there can be use cases where zstd 0.7.1 can be favorable to brotli 0.4.0 -- particularly those where a 32+ MB file is compressed at once and the 150-500 MB&#x2F;s compression speed range, but even this simple compression test shows that brotli can compress significantly (5-10+ %) more with the higher quality settings."

That&#x27;s where GPUs come in.</i><p>You can already scan these data volumes in millisconds on traditional hardware without doing too much fancy stuff or using GPUs. My original point was that I have a hard time coming up with an &quot;interactive analytics&quot; usecase where you&#x27;d want to process TB&#x2F;s on one node that can keep only a few gigs around -- the improvement of doing this on GPUs instead of the old fashioned way on general purpose hardware seems to be that a query over the same dataset returns a few milliseconds faster. I reckon a user running interactive sql queries doesn&#x27;t really care if their queries return in 10, 50 or 100ms -- I am not even sure I would be able to notice that difference myself.

experience one of their seconds. During the time they experience one of
their seconds, the speed increases more than 9.8 m&#x2F;s, so they must
experience greater than 1g acceleration. I haven&#x27;t done the math but it

frame needs to reduce to ensure constant acceleration in the ship&#x27;s
reference frame, and how long it would really take to reach .99c

The default (200) means all workers combined should not do more than 8 MB&#x2F;s reads or 4 MB&#x2F;s writes, which on current hardware are rather low limits. Increasing the number of workers is good, but the total autovacuum throughput does not change - there will be more workers but they&#x27;ll go slower.<p>Also a note regarding the delay - the resolution really depends on hardware. Some timers have only 10ms resolution, for example."

"&gt; I imagine a single &quot;blade&quot; would be moved less by the same amount of wind, but there are probably plenty of factors I&#x27;m not considering.<p>Modern wind turbines have a cut in wind speed of maybe 3.5m&#x2F;s and my guess is that these wind masts don&#x27;t have a cut-in speed. So in low wind resource regions they may be effective at capturing market share because they can produce electricity with only a slight breeze.<p>&gt; I imagine scaling these up you have some pretty crazy engineering problems to overcome, like how to deal with the repeated strain at the base.<p>Modern turbines have plenty of vibrations that the tower and foundation have to deal with. I was in the nacelle of a wind turbine when a surprise small tornado came to town, we were full on rodeo mode with the tower swaying back and forth. That being said on a day to day basis most of the forces are countered with the rotating mass (someone else can explain this better than I) so the turbine doesn&#x27;t transfer much horizontal load to the foundation.<p>With the wind mast there would be most horizontal load on the foundation as there is not another blade or two to counteract the motion and thus it would require a larger foundation.<p>If you want to buy a 4kw turbine you can find one used for under $7k which is much less than this new technology. As better 3 bladed tech comes online there will be a larger second market for used turbines and thus might be a better economic option then buying unproven new wind mast technology. Pairing used or new wind tech to batteries can really benefit the offtaker depending on the marketplace."

"&gt; Does this mean that error will compound if either the attitude or compensation are calculated or performed incorrectly? If so, is there a way to reduce that compounding, perhaps by making them more independent systems?<p>It&#x27;s more the opposite. (well, not quite exactly the opposite, but I&#x27;ll try to explain. It&#x27;s a simplified explanation, I hope I didn&#x27;t make any obvious error in the simplification)<p>IRU is mainly composed of gyroscope, measuring the spacecraft angular rate over three axis. They don&#x27;t give you the absolute orientation. Of course, if you know the initial orientation, you could integrate angular rotation and have the current one. Except that in reality, you have several problems. The first one is that even if you have a perfect unbiased gyro, you need a continuous time integration, and not use sample every 0.X seconds. But the main problem of gyro are the instantaneous bias, and the slow change in bias over time. And when you integrate bias over a long time, the result diverge (all the type of gyroscope have these, but the level are different. There is also added noise on top and quantisation of the output. You get value over 8, 12 or 16 bits, not a real number. But integrating this should average to 0, so that&#x27;s ok)<p>So you can&#x27;t use only an IRU.<p>Could you use only a star tracker? Again, in an ideal world, yes. The star tracker gives you the absolute orientation and if you want the angular rate, you can get it by derivation (by differentiating, in discrete time) But the star tracker has its own problem. It cannot gives you an orientation when you turn it on, it has an acquisition phase first. It does not work when you have the sun in the field of view, or the earth, and sometimes also the moon. (it&#x27;s basically a camera trying to take picture of the stars.Plus a lot of complicated software) As it includes a lot of complicated software, you don&#x27;t necessarily want to use it in safe mode (software has bug. Also it uses electrical power) Sometime STT don&#x27;t work when the rotation speed is too high also. And complexity also means more failure modes.<p>So STT only for all phases, including safe mode, if often not accepted by the system engineer&#x2F;the satellite final client&#x2F;the quality assurance department&#x2F;... (sometimes its just not possible)<p>So what is usually done on satellite including both an IRU and a STT is to blend their data together. That gives you an accurate position (coming from the STT when it is ok, or by integrating the IRU data for &quot;short&quot; period when you get the sun in the field of view, for example), an estimation of the (current) gyro bias, and an accurate rotation rate (by using the IRU data minus the estimated bias)(this is usually based on a (extended) Kalman filter, but there are probably other methods)<p>With all this, you actually get a better attitude and rotation rate than IRU or STT alone. (when going in safe mode, you will probably switch to an attitude estimation based on IRU and some inaccurate but really simple sun sensor. Safe mode usually only wants to point some satellite axis to the sun with a bad accuracy, up to a few degree)<p>When everything works fine, it&#x27;s nice.<p>But according to what they say, it seems that they have got an error in the algorithm (or some specific bug triggered by some strange sequence). There was the Earth in the field of view of the STT (so it was unavailable), then it has been to acquisition mode (no usable data), the tracking mode (data is good). At this point, there is a huge gap in the bias estimation (this kind of stuff happens when you re initiate a filter, or when conditions change), it&#x27;s supposed to converge relatively fast to the good value (with &quot;fast&quot; being dependent on your algorithm). But during this convergence phase, they think that the STT did go back to acquisition mode. (for some reason, not completely clear). The estimated bias had a relatively high value (21 deg&#x2F;h. Big for a bias), not corresponding to the real bias. But the satellite has keep using this value, until it finally reached safe mode.<p>It&#x27;s not clear if it continued to use this bias value in safe mode, but it does not really matter (21 deg&#x2F;h bias is not that big when you start using thrusters. It may use more fuel than needed but that&#x27;s 0.3 deg&#x2F;s. Relatively small). An error in other data uploaded in the software had basically transformed the safe mode to a kill mode (from what I understand, any transition to safe would have been extremely bad)"

"I really don&#x27;t get how they came up with those numbers comparing CPUs to GPUs.<p>They claim to have 3.5x as much on-chip memory as a GPU, but the R9 Fury X has 16.7 MiB of <i>register</i> memory compared to their 28MiB. And then of course there&#x27;s caches on top of that (which funnily add up to less than the register memory, I believe).<p>I also don&#x27;t get how they come up with those MAC numbers.

"You have 250GB of &quot;raw&quot; data stored in CSV format. The parsed version of this data in memory is likely to be a fraction of the on-disk size. A `long` or `double` only take up eight bytes in memory but 10-20 bytes on disk stored as ASCII in a CSV file. Even if your raw data was 250GB you could store it in memory mapped files. A fast SSD can easily hit a gigabyte per second sequential read speed, far faster than your typical network.<p>Segmenting your raw data and using memory mapped files will let you work with large data sets without needing huge amounts of RAM. From there it&#x27;s a question of your single system&#x27;s processing speed and IO capacity. This is only necessary if your processing needs random access to the entire dataset.<p>If your CSV data is more like a streaming data source, you&#x27;re processing each record as it&#x27;s read in, you can just stream it in through `stdin`. At 1GB&#x2F;s you&#x27;re looking at five minutes or so to process your 250GB of raw data. A SATA SSD might take twenty minutes to stream that raw data."
"There is a small write amplification due to pg page size being 8KB and ZFS recordsize being 128KB, but considering the Bulk write nature there is not much impact. Also max IO size of EBS is 256KB which helps us to optimally utilise available IOPS even if there is write amplification. Reducing the ZFS recordsize significantly reduces compression ratio so we kept as it is. If it&#x27;s an OLTP application, reducing the recordsize will improve latency but for these bulk operations, it&#x27;s the most suitable.<p>I haven&#x27;t used Azure, but based on my raw benchmark and real time usage, I would say type of FileSystem doesn&#x27;t affect performance of EBS Volumes. Our peak IO usage is 1200 IOPS and 20 MB&#x2F;s. I would say similar RDS configuration would have x4 - x10 write amplification due to data being not compressed."

"Brainwave FPGAs sit directly on the NIC of the server; every FPGA essentially acts as a 40GB&#x2F;s passthru NIC to a host machine, and each one can talk to the Microsoft SDN  completely on its own independent of the host CPU, in order to bind multiple devices together to create aggregate compute units. FPGAs in a server are partitioned into multiple RTL blocks (so 1 FPGA can host&#x2F;execute multiple workloads concurrently, not unlike a cloud server), and the &quot;outer&quot; RTL simply routes messages, shuffling packets between RTL blocks, or RTL blocks on different hosts. Thus the CPU is more-or-less cut out of the fast path in a lot of cases, and acts more like a control plane.<p>Brainwave can deploy to hybrid FPGA&#x2F;CPU topologies, however (where part of the design is on an FPGA, and part is on a CPU, and they coordinate over the SDN), so the choice of underlying accelerator is flexible and they can scale independent of available capacity.<p>Microsoft has effectively created a hardware microservice architecture for their large scale FPGA deployments, because the capacity is essentially elastic, and the hardware exposes miniature services that directly talk on the network and coordinate to execute large-scale jobs."

"Obviously, bandwidth is not the same as latency.<p>GPUs cards makers the trade of between bandwidth and latency i n favor of latency. When you&#x27;re doing mostly branch free processing in large chunks that&#x27;s the trade of to make. All you need is a strait forward pre-fetcher and you don&#x27;t need to worry about latency.<p>That&#x27;s not true for general purpose CPUs that perform lots of branches, that need to predicted (so we can predict what to fetch). The data processed on CPUs tends to be different (structures vs. vectors) and lots of pointer chasing (vtables, linked lists, hash tables, trees). That requires lower latencies since the access pasterns a lot more random.<p>The stated goal of HBM is taming the power consumption (and thus also heat) of GPU systems while keeping the same (or higher) bandwidth. The name HBM stands for high bandwidth memory.<p>And while HBM has a lower clock frequency compared to GDDR5 (like 1&#x2F;4) it has a much wider bus. The bus on HBM is 1024 bits vs 32 bits for GDDR. At one time it can send 32x times the data in the bus. 32x &#x2F; 4 = 8. The transfer rate of is 8 times bigger. The recent radeon cards with HBM now have memory transfer speeds of 256GB&#x2F;s vs the 48GB for GGDR5.<p>Again, HBM trades latency for bandwidth. It negates some the latency drops due to  1&#x2F;4 of the clock by putting the HBM memory on die vs off die.<p>I think you&#x27;re conflating a few different arguments. GPU workloads are not latency sensitive, so in GPU land transfer speed (bandwidth) is speed."

I wonder if that&#x27;s the reason for somewhat patchy USB performance. when copying data between two USB HDDs the data goes at 40-50MB&#x2F;s for a minute or two then drops down to like 500kb&#x2F;s and then ramps up again after a while. When copying data the USB chip and the ports themselves get stupidly hot.

"They don&#x27;t get it because they aren&#x27;t buying it. But yes, 30Mbps is what you&#x27;d expect to get at those 96% of households if you bought whichever of the mainstream services offers &gt;30Mbps<p>That might be a VDSL product from any of the popular ISPs (if you live with a few hundred metres of a &quot;green box&quot;), a cable product if you live in one of the cities or larger towns that have cable, or dedicated fibre link.<p>Some people see significantly worse performance because of their own suboptimal choices (e.g. maybe the blinking lights on the supplied VDSL modem annoy you so you run a telephone extension to a different room and lose 4Mbps of bandwidth because crappy telephone extensions don&#x27;t do high bandwidth networking very well) and over a population of millions some will see physical network problems, that may need repair before they see the intended performance. But on the whole this 30Mbps coverage figure is based on extrapolating measurements from real users over data about available service.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any 16MB&#x2F;s products (16MB&#x2F;s = 128Mbps or maybe you just meant 16Mbps) but Lewisham, which you gave as an example, has VDSL available at all the consumer nodes, so unless you lived in the £5M penthouse of some mixed use building in Docklands you <i>could</i> have bought faster networking you just didn&#x27;t.<p>It can seem like surely if they could offer 30Mbps VDSL, why is my ADSL only 1Mbps? But that&#x27;s misunderstanding the technology. ADSL was deployed in the UK to exchanges, so the signal needs to get from your home to an actual telephone exchange, there&#x27;s probably one in your borough but it might be well over a mile away. However VDSL is in street cabinets, so your signal only travels to the cabinet which might be only a few hundred metres away. This makes it somewhat more expensive but also a lot faster. Unless (in both cases) you don&#x27;t buy it."
"It&#x27;s important to note that the first stage (which is about 70% of the rocket) is the part that is being reused. The top of the rocket (the second stage, the fairings, and the payload) are not reused (At least not yet. They are working on recovering fairings and there are rumors of second stage reuse).<p>When the stages separate, the first stage is going about 1.5 - 2.5 km&#x2F;s. Then the second stage takes the payload the rest of the way to orbital speeds of 7+ km&#x2F;s, and the first stage returns to earth.<p>So the first stage is going fast (several thousand miles per hour) but not as fast as things that re-enter from orbit. It still does need heat shielding, but not as much as the space shuttle or a capsule."

"I&#x27;ve been a SpiderOak customer since 2011.  Long story short, I agree that performance is slow to the point of abysmal.

If they could just double or triple the speed for uploading it&#x27;d be a huge boon to me, but realistically most of the places I&#x27;ve gone in the world being able to upload 2MB&#x2F;s is faster than my local Internet is capable of."

"For a typical hydroelectric dam, kinetic energy is not particularly important (although smaller kinetic hydroelectric plants do exist). The relevant factors are pressure (determined by the hydraulic head) and volumetric flow.<p>In ideal conditions, if you have two sections of identical pipe, and a turbine in the middle, water flowing through the pipe will not change velocity (incompressible fluid, and none is gained or lost), yet the turbine can harvest one Joule per cubic metre per Pascal of pressure.<p>This is the predominant principle by which a dam works; it creates a large pressure differential, and then drives a turbine at a relatively much slower velocity than the maximum possible by converting all the GPE to KE.<p>To adapt this to your chutes idea. Water will not pour down the longer chute significantly quicker than the shorter one, yet if you fill them, the longer chutes will have a proportionately larger pressure at the bottom. Thus a flow of 1m^3&#x2F;s will deliver proportionately more energy across a turbine which reduces the pressure to ambient."

"Okay, I&#x27;ll try again.<p>AFAIK, the number 1 shows up in nature, it actually represents either an everything (this entire atom) or a 0-1 continuum.<p>When the number 2 shows up in nature, it&#x27;s always balanced opposing somethings. Newton&#x27;s third law, matter &#x2F; antimatter, negative&#x2F;positive electric charge, n&#x2F;s on a magnet.<p>When the number 3 shows up in nature, you actually get a set of things. Proton, neutrons, electrons; and perhaps this theory now runs into a problem because I&#x27;m not thinking of another trinity.<p>So, if you have two things, and they&#x27;re not opposites, they imply more things in the category. If you have one thing in a category, and it&#x27;s not an everything or a spectrum (of the everything), it implies more things  in the category. If you have three things in a category, they only imply more things if two of them have a symmetrical relationship (resistors, inductors, capacitors). The category may still have more things. but it&#x27;s not otherwise implied."

For an Anycast DNS service, you don&#x27;t need that in every site -- if you&#x27;re willing to take small sites offline and degrade your service&#x27;s end-user performance in this scenario. You will still need it in 2-3 sites, probably located in US west &#x2F; US east &#x2F; EU west because of the cost of datacenter space and the availability of cheap connectivity.<p>Serving 100Gbit&#x2F;s requires 20 10G circuits in each site (~$15-30k&#x2F;mo), 80 servers (2-3 racks, so $5-10k&#x2F;mo), and a not-so-cheap router.<p>So your monthly opex is $20-40k per site, $60-120k worldwide.

"Most of your points about off-shore wind aren&#x27;t quite right..<p>&gt; These prices are set to go up, as the easy sites for installation are running out.<p>This isn&#x27;t even remotely true... You can measure the number of offshore farms in the dozens, there are something like 1,500 cities with populations of at least 500,000 - and most of these are close enough to the water to make broad use of offshore wind power. For instance, there&#x27;s 1 operating off-shore farm in the US right now.<p>&gt; New-built offshore wind costs €3-4.7b&#x2F;GW<p>Like pointed out elsewhere, this is true if you only look at off-shore costs. On shore wind is more like $1,250&#x2F;KW. Importantly though, it&#x27;s only true <i>today</i>. We&#x27;re rapidly increasing the size of turbines and the height of towers. Most of the existing installations used 4&#x2F;5&#x2F;6-MW turbines. Vestas has already shipped a 9.5MW turbine. We&#x27;ll likely see 20MW turbines within 5-7 years.<p>If you&#x27;re building a 500MW off-shore farm with 5MW turbines, you&#x27;ll need 100 foundations, towers, turbines, you&#x27;ll need 300 blades and maintenance will have to service each one individually. Increasing those to 10MW cuts all of those costs in half (more likely, by 30% or so to account for scale). Doubling the size again has the same magnitude of impact. With 20MW turbines, a 500MW farm would only need 25 turbines and 75 blades.<p>The other benefit from these much larger turbines is that they&#x27;d sit much higher. If you increase the hub height from 100M to 150M or 200M, all of the sudden you&#x27;re looking at sustained annual average winds approaching 20m&#x2F;s. The wind shapes shift significantly as you increase altitude as well, so you can go from c=12, k=2 to c=20, k=3.5.  This should easily move the capacity factors from ~50% to ~70+%.<p>&gt; and, most severely, the expected lifetime of ~25 years[5] compared to 60+ years for nuclear.<p>Nobody serious expects that wind farms will only last 25 years. They&#x27;ll last in perpetuity as long as their servicing costs stay below the marginal revenue from production. The initial lifetime expectations of nuclear reactors was 40 years, which has been extended for many plants. The same will happen with wind resources for many of the same reasons (high decommissioning costs, the challenges of siting a new generator, proven financial success at that location, etc.)."

"I think we both realize that it&#x27;s a bit silly to have so much data in textures that you have 100x the pixel data of a 5 second shot at 4k with 32 bit float rgb.  650GB of textures would mean that even with 10gb ethernet (which I&#x27;m not sure is common yet) you would wait at least 12 minutes just for the textures to get to the computer before rendering could start and rendering 100 frames at a time would mean 100GB&#x2F;s from a file server for a single shot. Even a single copy of the textures to freeze an iteration would be thousands in expensive disk space.<p>I know it doesn&#x27;t makes sense to tell your clients that what they are doing is nonsense, but if I saw something like that going on, the first thing I would do is chase down why it happened.

"It&#x27;s not required to have DOCSIS 3.1 to have 100Mbit&#x2F;s symmetry, 3.0 can provide that. 
Vodafone in Spain has a mixture of HFC footprint (the widest), its own small FTTH footprint, and Telefonica (Spain&#x27;s DTAG) wholesale FTTH. Prices and speeds for the three of them are the same, but if you are on an FTTH zone you get symmetric upload speeds, while on HFC zones they provide 100Mbit&#x2F;s upload with all their plans (min download is also 100MBit&#x2F;s).<p>They argue they will be able to have symmetry on 1Gbit on HFC when they complete their DOCSIS 3.1 rollout, but that has been going on for years with no news. Ironically their own FTTH footprint is pretty small so they end up, in most cases, providing better upload speeds when reselling Telefonica infrastructure than with their own."

"Projectile vs. rocket.<p>The calculation is entirely correct -- we cannot shoot a projectile into space. There is no sensible way to get something to go fast enough to make it to space from Earth with no further propulsion. A better argument, actually, is about acceleration. In order to not be utterly crushed, a projectile would need a massive vertical track to be shot into space. Earth&#x27;s escape velocity is around 10km&#x2F;s. g=10m&#x2F;s^2. If we assume maximum acceleration of 10g to not crush the pilot, to get out, we&#x27;d need to accelerate at 10g for 1,000 seconds. During that time, we&#x27;d travel a few thousand kilometers. Accelerating faster -- as with a nuclear explosion -- only exasperates the problem.<p>We solved the problem by having propulsion the whole way up. We can fire a rocket into space, and it can take it&#x27;s sweet time to get up there."

"&gt;But claiming someone has privilege isn&#x27;t a value judgement on the person, or a sin...Saying someone has privilege is just pointing out the state of the world, it isn&#x27;t a judgment.<p>That is exactly the same argument that bigots use when they talk about {minorities, poor people, immigrants, LGBT people}.  &quot;That person fits into category X, and everyone in category X shares some characteristic Y because they&#x27;re in that category.

"Russia launched about a dozen Proton rockets a year at the time of Columbia disaster, two Soyuz spacecrafts and two-three Progress spacecrafts.<p>Proton used to launch several Soyuz without Orbital Section, called Zond, in 1960s, with booster DM to fly around the Moon. DM adds about 3 km&#x2F;s of deltaV. Orbital plane change for 7 degrees - between Baikonur&#x27;s 46 and Columbia&#x27;s 39 - takes sin(7)*8 km&#x2F;s = 1 km&#x2F;s. So technically it could be considered to launch (several) Progress ship(s) with necessary cargos to Columbia while three unmanned Soyuzes would be prepared and sent to the rescue. Soyuz approaches Columbia, gets caught by manipulator, astronauts use spacesuits from Soyuz - which have to be extracted from Soyuz first.<p>ISS, meanwhile, had to be kept without ships, which means landing the crew, hopefully temporarily.<p>All that could be considered.

"That requires the middle managers to actually understand the jobs and responsibilities of their staff. For me, this hasn&#x27;t been the case in over a decade. Since my current boss doesn&#x27;t really have a technical understanding of what&#x27;s involved with his teams responsibilities, he instead simply feeds metrics to his boss (also not technical). These metrics range from tickets closed, system uptime, and &quot;automation.&quot; I would love to have the Bobs come in and ask him what he actually does here.<p>It&#x27;s also important to realize that what middle management wants and what its staff thinks is important usually diverges.

"The classic goodput vs throughput debate. E.g. Gigabit Ethernet is most commonly actually physically transmitted at 1.25 gigabit&#x2F;s because of 8b10b coding. Ethernet requires interpacket gaps, and the packetization itself changes overhead. Then of course you have other protocol overheads underneath you could consider, and how much overhead the data you were transmitting has due to encoding of it itself.<p>In the end there is really &quot;bandwidth&quot; which is how much symbol &quot;space&quot; is available and various levels of &quot;goodput&quot; which is the rate of whatever you&#x27;re calling useful data."

"Getting sound and audio into Arduino projects has been difficult, because there are almost no integrated DAC and amplifier solutions for the Arduino Shield format.

High compression encoding (no need for real-time), and then sending 15 seconds of audio surrounding an &quot;event&quot; over a LoRa network (0.3 kbps to 50 kbps) can provide context to the event, or be recognized and actioned by Siri &#x2F; Cortana &#x2F; Google in the Cloud.<p>I&#x27;m planning to make an audio environmental monitor which can sample sound at a location, and upload it to an IoT provider as needed. High sound levels alone are often not enough to determine what is good sound (wind noise), and what is bad sound (music at 3am), so having 15 seconds (for example) can be enough to differentiate a response."

"I think you&#x27;re ignoring the fundamental issue when deploying container based services v&#x2F;s services on a multiple VM&#x27;s. Usually, the architecture for containers involves spinning up a bunch of VM&#x27;s and deploying some kind of layer on top of that (either K8s or Swarm or something else). When you deploy containers, they may not be on the same VM, or the overlay network itself may require some kind of communication to another container on another VM. <i>This</i> usually creates a lot more communication b&#x2F;w hosts and rate limiting becomes the bottleneck."

"Space Engineers - I want to mod it. It&#x27;s been released for 7 years now - Keen Software has been keeping it intact and adding features (VRage). I think of it as Minecraft but with a near-true physics engine.<p>There is terrain deformation according to the force exerted by the object crashing into it. Ships colliding will either destroy or crush blocks according to that force. A &quot;grid&quot; is considered a powered assimilation of blocks, which could function as static &quot;station&quot; or moving vehicle. Thrust is measured in Newtons, block locations are measured in Cartesian coordinates. Everything has precise mass (kilogram) and this effects collision damage. Someone made a mod where there are aerodynamics (atmospheric force on fast traveling bodies, though this is computationally expensive). There is already a large workshop of mods that other players have made.<p>I say &quot;near-true&quot; physics because gravity of planets only stretches out a few kilometers above the planet. After that there is &quot;zero&quot; gravity and you can turn engines off and stay in that spot forever. Ship speeds are capped at 100 m&#x2F;s. These limitations are required for now because computers cannot keep up with that many calculations especially if grids are interacting and causing terrain deformation or casting functions often.<p>There are sim speed drops during large scale events, and that is a challenge that draws me in. Keen uses rendering tricks for view distance draw and object visibility according to user settings (reflecting the power of their PC), eventually I&#x27;d like to standardize things so that players could interact planet-side without trees disappearing and nullifying camouflage attempts.<p>The vanilla game requires you to find and extract ore (iron, magnesium, nickel, platinum, cobalt, silver, gold, uranium, more could be added if you wish). These elements can produce things that somewhat reflect their utility IRL, then they are refined using energy (solar, wind, battery, nuclear, hydrogen). Then produced into components that you weld into the block for its completion.<p>When you join an official server right now, you are confined to a max speed, as this is a safety measure to prevent the game from crashing. A server sets up conditions for players to build in their secret remote spot away from everyone else, though sometimes they will group into factions. There is seldom any interaction and NPC ships are randomly spawned in near the player, flying in a straight line - they have no deeper function and they are meant to be your salvage.<p>My big picture is that there should be no speed limit, but players locations give off visual signatures if they want to go fast all the time. Space implies distance, and distance implies travel, which implies a set amount of time. Controlling this time would be key to bringing players together much more often, and we will remove risk of their creations being destroyed (automated respawn, at some sort of liquidity cost, which players will be ultimately competing for by chasing objectives that the game already allows - mining and transporting mass).<p>I want there to be a real functioning economy, where dumping a load of ore on the market has real repercussions, like EVE Online. If you see the price of iron go down fast, you&#x27;ll know this has happened. So a player gets a huge cash payout, even though they are selling far below market rates because they wants to &quot;get rid&quot; of bulk iron (which costs them energy and time, of either him or his bots). Because of this event, you as a market participant can buy that up and the reduced price, and have a cheaper source of iron that takes you less time (transport). AI agents will also respond to these events in varying degrees of effectiveness, in order to create competition that economically active players must consider. We want the higher level players to have production assets and ownership in the economy, whereas newcomers can choose to pirate, pillage, or mercenary contracts which rewards them with liquidity if they succeed, which results in them being able to buy equipment quickly and return to combat, but other players may be funding this behavior by selling the ships and weapons produced with ore and energy.<p>I said big picture because all of these things would come in time only after some sort of standardized transport system was put into place, which the game needs now (it currently uses a simple jump drive which makes you suddenly appear in a new spot) - if we allow extremely fast travel speeds there cannot be collisions otherwise the SIM speed will drop.<p>Since there are so many physics elements, this game feels like a canvas and I&#x27;d eventually want to implement concepts to suggest new technologies that actually may be up and coming in real life. Think of it as a sort of education platform in that regard, but when you don&#x27;t want to learn, you can just go and realistically blow up space ships and compete on a leaderboard."
"The games are only temporarily marked down, what you are observing is discounting as a promotional tool because discounts get in front of more people than full-price games.<p>These are not perpetual discounts that would make the defacto real price be the discounted price.  After the launch week&#x2F;s the game price will revert and eventually fluctuate from being occasionally discounted, included in bundles, given away etc.<p>Discounts are an important sales tool for games - you can see major publishers today are pretty much constantly offering big discounts on one store at a time.  Steam etc all have discounted game lists, websites track game deals, there&#x27;s a huge subreddit for them at r&#x2F;gamedeals, there&#x27;s sites tracking the lowest-ever prices for games etc."

You can&#x27;t say it&#x27;ll improve things if your confidence is lower than your original threshold!<p>A 95% confidence doesn&#x27;t magically translate into a binary decision of winner v&#x2F;s no decision. A 90% confidence means that the variation is more likely to be better than control, but of course not as likely if confidence was 95%. The p-value is an arbitrary cut-off. (A p-value of 0.945 shouldn&#x27;t make you throw your results) Of course, in fields such as clinical trials, you&#x27;d want to be <i>very</i> sure of your results and might not want to take chances, but on the web when you&#x27;re running many tests, you are usually OK with something that is probable to work better than the existing version.<p>Of course, if it is a high stakes A&#x2F;B test on the web, you&#x27;d be as careful as a clinical trial design. We&#x27;re working towards making all those techniques available within the tool itself."
"The reason why spinning disks still stick around is not just because of the price. Often, it is the case that you do not need 200-500MBit&#x2F;s and ~100+ are enough. I have my OS on a (small) SSD and my spinning disks filled with my documents, music, movies. All of this does not need high speed, so it would be wasted money to buy an SSD for it. I&#x27;d rather buy twice the storage and do RAID1 (which I did)."
"The X way of doing window updates became impractical with common graphics-heavy applications like web browsers. I could already feel this in the mid-90&#x27;s when opening a browser window on a 19&quot; NCD X-Terminal took several seconds over 10mbit&#x2F;s Ethernet (noticeable because most other X client applications at that time used drawing primitives and appeared instantly).<p>For modern applications (graphics- and video-heavy), VNC&#x2F;RFB seems like a much more suitable protocol, although I haven&#x27;t really kept up with the latest X extensions that probably cover some of these applications.<p>Personally, I liked the X architecture more (despite X&#x27;s inherent complexity) and expected it to become more popular with cloud-hosted applications etc., but as applications and GUI toolkits evolved in an unsuitable way (i.e. not using X&#x27;s primitives), it&#x27;s probably time to let go. Or to build a proper GUI toolkit first..."
Aren&#x27;t they also saying that 5800kb&#x2F;s is not enough for some bits of some movies?<p>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed this - on 1080 full bluray files the bitrate swings enormously - from 2mbit&#x2F;sec up to 50mbit&#x2F;sec (so much so my Chromecast wifi can&#x27;t keep up in high action scenes).<p>So I definitely think they will be able to make improvements to their 1080p content (and definitely 4k content - I don&#x27;t think 25mbit&#x2F;sec CBR is enough IMO).

"Ordinary users pay 59 euros (65 dollars) for a wireless access point. Typically they pay somebody 20 euros to install the directed antenna outside the building.
For directed wifi connections, you can get up to 20-50 Mb&#x2F;s or single digit Mb&#x2F;s. Some links are very long - up to 10 kms. Obviously, over many hops it degrades, but most traffic goes to the Internet gateway right now - which is never too far. There are also users around the network with outside access who offer their machines as Internet proxies. Many of these are used, so a lot of traffic terminates inside Guifi.net at those points as well.<p>The cost was born by people who wanted cheap Internet. 65 bucks for free Internet."

And this gives the sculptor too much credit, since it&#x27;s just a creation of a stationary, dead object. True art comes from real movement of bodies on the stage. But this isn&#x27;t true art either, for it&#x27;s ephemeral. Clearly, a movie would have the most encoded information, and is thus the most credible art. But this is laziness, for anyone can hit record, it must be the person who photographs, who chooses the exact moment to capture, rather than the person who says &quot;capture everything&quot; that can truly get at the essence of art. &#x2F;s"

"I think we&#x27;re debating definitional points. In this context, I was equating thinking faster and thinking better; if you and I would---when faced with a problem---arrive at conclusion Q, and the AI would arrive at Q twice as fast, it&#x27;s thinking better.<p>So if we distinguish thinking faster (I&#x27;ve doubled the rate at which the algorithm runs) from thinking better (I&#x27;ve refined the algorithm so it only takes half as many &quot;brain cycles&quot; or what have you), I don&#x27;t disagree that there&#x27;s no guarantee that a faster AI would improve its own algorithm---but I would disagree that a human-level AI with twice the thought speed of a human wouldn&#x27;t &quot;outstrip humanity.&quot; It stands to reason that it should be able to outstrip humanity on any problem domain requiring cognition, simply by definition of measurement (if the machine is coming up with answers twice as fast as its human counterparts, it&#x27;s &quot;outstripping humanity&quot;).<p>I also hold to the assertion that it wouldn&#x27;t take too many improvements to get orders-of-magnitude past organic brains. The fastest nerve impulses are clocked in the range of 120 m&#x2F;s. If you took the pattern of a human brain and replaced the meat with electronic switching, you&#x27;d be improving the raw rate of flow by about a million. Given that you&#x27;ve already conceded hypothetically that P is reproducible, electronics alone (without such niceties as optic fiber for any really big jumps), you&#x27;d be looking at the processes of P occurring at an (upper-bound) million times the speed it does in the human brain. Does this prove a lower-bound improvement? No; after all, it&#x27;s not raw speed but switching and parallelization that matters if we&#x27;re replicated a human brain.<p>But I submit to you that the lower bound of improvement by transitioning from meat to electronic is probably more than &#x27;2&#x27;. ;)"

"That sucks for citizens of the US.

"The woman cannot go from being &quot;not in path&quot; to &quot;in path&quot; instantaneously unless you believe in teleportation.

Suppose a speed of 12 ft&#x2F;s (~8mph), the car would have had a minimum of 8&#x2F;100ths of a second to react. Supposing 3 ft of visibility before in path (about the distance from edge of car to lane), the car would have a minimum of ~1&#x2F;3 second to react. That&#x27;s assuming the woman was biking along at a good clip already, which is unlikely given that she was crossing a road. So, in all likelihood, the car had over 1&#x2F;3 of a second to do something.

Could save $100 here with a lower SSD. This one also has the latest Intel WiFi 6 chipset.<p>$100 for power supply, $100 for case, $30 for quieter fans.<p>Including tax and everything the total came out to around $1600. After deciding the specs I spent some time looking for comparable laptops and they were all much more expensive. I didn&#x27;t do anything special to save. You could get this exact same build for a bit cheaper today I think; I did this in November. I just purchased a second one of the same GPU this week and it was $20 cheaper. The other components have probably also had some drops in price."

Or are we supposed to believe we can push megabytes&#x2F;s nonstop all month?

"At just 60 MB&#x2F;s it doesn&#x27;t matter much (even 512 byte blocks would just be a little more than 100k syscalls &#x2F; second).

Since no read merging happens, small reads like 4k or 32k start to hurt earlier, especially if the FS is written in an interpreter. Some of these also mishandled small reads, incurring an additional penalty (I know because I fixed that in an implementation)."

"From my perspective, &#x27;brain training&#x27; is one more cliched bs pile of crap nonsense similar to the retarded phrase &#x27;climate change&#x27;. There is nothing to ponder simply because the most powerful thought one can achieve is basically to have no thought&#x2F;s whatsoever. When an individual can perceive the light body as a vessel designed to do more than thought itself is even capable of (reason), then one can receive true knowledge by the act of being open to information instead of the backasswards concept of more thought is more information. In practice, thoughts are like commands and one thought all by itself is an extremely powerful facet of awareness. People are themselves their own stumbling blocks. The basic purpose of attention is to simply make things happen. What I find interesting is that simple logic goes hand in hand with truths. If you find yourself in a quagmire of noise trying to understand something, you are complicating it beyond it&#x27;s logical efficient boundaries. Truth has it&#x27;s own mathematical inverse proportion which paradoxically is true from both perspectives wherein the singular truth viewpoint is mirrored exactly opposite the universal truth viewpoint."

"While a GPU has excellent memory bandwidth and lots of parallel processors, its connection to the rest of the system makes it not ideal for database work.

"&gt; We&#x27;ll be generous and say that 4TB can do 150MB&#x2F;s. A single run through the data at maximum efficiency will cost you ~8 hours. Since we&#x27;ve restricted ourselves to a single box, we&#x27;re also not going to be able to keep the data in memory for subsequent calculations&#x2F;simulations&#x2F;whatever.<p>I agree with your overall point, but of course the actual limits for a fairly cost effective single box are fairly high these days. E.g. from my preferred (UK) vendor, 4x PCIe based 960GB SSD&#x27;s (each card is really 4 SSD&#x27;s + controllers) adds up to an additional $7500. We often get 800MB&#x2F;sec with a single card.<p>Your point still holds - the actual thresholds are just likely to be quite a bit higher than what the performance of a single 4TB hd might imply.<p>Tack on 40+ cores, and 1TB RAM, and the cost to purchase a server like that is somewhere around the $60k mark in the UK (without shopping around or building it yourself), but that adds up to &quot;only&quot; about $2k&#x2F;month in leasing costs.

"&gt; The actual &#x27;bug&#x27; was caused by an integer overflow occurring due to the velocity variable not being wide enough to handle the higher horizontal velocities of the newer rocket. This caused the rocket to go off course and require termination.<p>This is not entirely correct. The code which overflowed was unnecessary for flight. People have this idea that the sensor sensed it was going 32745 m&#x2F;s to the east one moment, and -32723 m&#x2F;s the next, and then tried to compensate for the sudden gust of wind it must have encountered. This is incorrect. The routine in question was only supposed to run when it was on the ground, and served no purpose in flight. It was scheduled to be disabled 40 seconds after launch. (The flight failed after 37 seconds)<p>The problem is specifically the fact that the code was written in Ada. Ada does not fail the way other languages fail when you overflow. Instead of given an incorrect value (which never would have impacted the flight) it throws an exception. This exception was uncaught. This uncaught exception brought down the entire flight control system, despite the fact that the falling code was not controlling flight.<p>Rust improves upon this situation by panicking in debug mode and wrapping in release mode, which is better than the Ada behavior in every possible way. Normal &quot;unsafe&quot; languages improve this by giving an incorrect value as the result, which in the case of Ariane V would have saved the flight."
"Even in &quot;still&quot; air, the individual molecules have random velocities due to temperature - on the order of 100 m&#x2F;s.

"That is incorrect the amplifiers have the capacity to amplify lots of channels simultaneously. So it is sufficient to only upgrade the endpoints (unless your fibre is full, where full means the bandwidth of the amplifiers, ~100 Tb&#x2F;s for a single fibre). This has in fact been the driver behind the tremendous growth in data rates we have seen in the last 30 years. Operators can incrementally upgrade links by upgrading the endpoints. To transfer a MB across the network was 100s of $ in the 90s and is now essentially free (it&#x27;s like 10e-4 cents or sol"

So I have a hard time to think of any application were a chip that is designed now does not have enough power to encrypt using AES, but has a need for somewhat high bandwidth communication."
"Yep, it is still a matter of abandoning the monolith and building a new scalable system in whatever fashion you choose at that time, micro services or whatever.<p>In today&#x27;s cloud deployments where cost is not a mega concern (as compared to having physical servers in a DC), this approach is very much feasible.<p>You could run two systems in parallel (monolith v&#x2F;s scalable) and ditch the monolith once you have the necessary cutover logistics in place.<p>Of course, the sooner you do this, the better and it is non trivial to figure out the &#x27;when&#x27;"

"Yes, of course customer service is top priority, at least it should be.<p>In my country, there are people intentionally staying on a cable ISP for their excellent support and the fact they carry non-government non-right-wing channels which are unwanted on other government-controlled ISPs (i.e. CNN affiliate). The cable ISP is slower and more expensive (up to 100% more) than FTTH at the government owned telco, but people really appreciate having problems fixed in a day after one call and not an agonizing process lasting months(!!) that often just ends with them cancelling your contract and waiving the early cancellation fee, and then blacklisting your location from getting service because it is problematic.<p>Also funnily enough we had that same problem with billing, it lasted for 18 months, during which time no correct bills were sent, no payments were logged and nobody&#x27;s service was shut off for non-payment. The ISP mostly forgave the debts [1] of all customers because they couldn&#x27;t keep track of it.

Imagine if in your magical world there are no drunk driving laws, because hey, let&#x27;s trust everyone to be capable blah blah blah. On that topic, substance abuse.. but hey &quot;my body, my problem?&quot; right?

Should I study more to advance my career? Yes. Should I have a better work-life balance? Yes. Am I doing those things? No, instead I&#x27;m spending time responding to crackpots on the Internet.<p>So yeah, trying to govern a society with your (IMO idiotic) assumptions is a stupid idea, because it&#x27;s a society we don&#x27;t have. Should we just cancel all drink driivng laws because we should assume right now that everyone will be responsible and not drink drive?

"I used to work for NERSC when they ran Seaborg.  Before that, i ran my PhD simulations on the T3E Mjolnir (PSC) and the other one, at SDSC whose name I forget.  Back in those days, those were supercomputers, but a single cloud machine replaces one of those now.<p>The only thing I consider a supercomputer is a device designed for capability computing where the capability is ability to run codes that exhibit strong scaling due to their interconnect.    The petaflops you quote are calculated by the strong scaling of LINPACK due to its design.  I think you need a large amount of petaflops these days to really be considered a supercomputer.  And those petaflops come from having a combination of low latency and high bandwidth-- you couldn&#x27;t just point at Exacycle and say &quot;that&#x27;s a supercomputer&quot;.<p>The 3PB filesystem and 50Gb&#x2F;s IO (you didn&#x27;t say if that was per-node, or the bisection bandwidth of the central switch, or what) aren&#x27;t particularly &quot;super&quot;.<p>In some sense this is just arguing about the definition of a supercomputer which isn&#x27;t super interesting; I have a preconceived notion of what one is.  If Amazon put a bunch of machines on an MPI switch (IIRC they actually have) and scored well in Top500, and you could buy time on it, and it scaled your code, they&#x27;d have one too."

"The example I saw didn&#x27;t seem that impractical.<p>A malicious process allocates a 256 member array.  Then it creates a conditional where the speculatively executed part writes a byte at offset array + kernel_memory_value.  The speculative branch is executed but then backed out, but the byte in the array was touched so it is in cache now.  Then the malicious process reads all of the members of the array and looks for one that returns much faster than expected (is in cache) and they know the value of that byte.  Rinse and repeat to read the rest of the kernel memory.  It&#x27;s not going to give you MB&#x2F;s of throughput, but it&#x27;s plenty fast to read some key material or process tables or anything like that.<p>It&#x27;s a very impressive attack.

"HN is too frequently updated, but for blogs or personal web pages it&#x27;s okay. You can either use IPNS or update a DNS record each time you update your content.

I have a reasonably good connection at home (a bit less than 1MB&#x2F;s up, a bit more than 10MB&#x2F;s down) and if I run the IPFS daemon locally I can&#x27;t really use my internet connection for anything else.

Am I wrong in thinking that school math is the closest to deliberate training in abstract reasoning that one would find in public education?<p>Abstract reasoning, intuition, and creativity, to me, represent the underpinnings of software engineering, and really, most engineering and science, but are taught more by osmosis along side the unintuitive often boring mechanics of subjects. The difference between a good engineer of any sort and one that &#x27;just knows the formulas&#x27; is the ability to fluently manipulate and reason with symbols and effects that don&#x27;t necessarily have any relation or simple metaphor in the tangible world.

"HPL has an abundance of flops at all scales (N^{1.5} flops on N data), so one can expect a decent fraction of peak flop&#x2F;s on any architecture with enough memory and adequate cache performance.  This is a problem because architectural tricks like doubling the vector registers without commensurate improvements in bandwidth, cache sizes, load&#x2F;store&#x2F;gather&#x2F;scatter produce huge (nearly 2x) benefit for HPL and little or no benefit to a large fraction of real applications.<p>HPGMG is representative of most structure-exploiting algorithms in that it does not have this abundance of flops, thus theoretical performance is actively constrained by both memory bandwidth and flop&#x2F;s.  We see many active constraints in practice; e.g., improving any of peak flop&#x2F;s, memory bandwidth, network latency, or network bandwidth produces a tangible improvement in HPGMG performance.  Depending on the fidelity of the performance model, these dimensions can be a fairly accurate predictor of performance, but ILP, compiler quality, on-node synchronization latency, cache sizes, and similar factors also matter (more for HPGMG-FE than HPGMG-FV).<p>I think it is actually quite undesirable for benchmark performance to be trivially computed from one parameter in machine provisioning.  No computing center has a mission statement asking for a place on a benchmark ranking list (like Top500).  Instead, they have a scientific or engineering mandate.  Press releases tend to overemphasize the ranking and I think it is harmful to the science any time the benchmark takes precedence over the expected scientific workload.  HPGMG is intended to be representative in the sense that if you build an &quot;HPGMG Machine&quot;, you&#x27;ll get a balanced, versatile machine that scientists and engineers in most disciplines will be happy with.  I&#x27;d still rather the centers focus on their workload instead of HPGMG."

"Right- Though the point of the post was to dispel the fallacy that the Linux kernel can only handle 50k pp&#x2F;s per core. Using RDMA effectively bypasses the kernel. He&#x27;s also testing with a SolarFlare card which doesn&#x27;t support DPDK, though it does support RDMA with OpenOnload. What I&#x27;ve found is that RDMA is the &quot;easy&quot; part to get right, as it&#x27;s fairly simple. Not every network card is created equal with respect to how many packets it can actually pass through to the kernel however, partially in part to the kernel driver (whether it&#x27;s using NAPI or not, driver efficiency, MSI-X support, interrupt coalescing) and the card itself (onboard buffer, latency characteristics, etc.) 10g cards max out at around 14Mpp&#x2F;s @ 60 bytes when the kernel is involved and everything is perfectly tuned. Which should be where the card he&#x27;s using falls. A generic onboard Intel card generally maxes out around 8-10Mpp&#x2F;s. But both would most likely be able to hit 16Mpp&#x2F;s @ 60 bytes if using RDMA in any form."

"There are several different aspects which make recovery hard. HPC tries to push the edge of what&#x27;s possible with hardware. It does this by throwing redundancy out the window.<p>First, the simulation can be set up to match the hardware. One simulation program I used expected that the nodes would be set up in a ring, so that messages between i and (i+1)%N were cheap. It ran on hardware with two network ports, one forwards and one backwards in the ring. In fact, the only way to talk between non-neighbors was to forwards through the neighbors.<p>If a node goes down, then the ring is broken, and the entire system goes down.<p>This is very different than a cluster with point-to-point communications, where a router can redirect a message to a backup node should one of the main nodes go down.<p>The reason for this architecture is that there&#x27;s a lot of inter-node traffic. When I was working on this topic back in the 1990s, we were network limited until we switched to fiber optic&#x2F;ATM. When you read about HPC you&#x27;ll hear a lot about high-speed interconnects, and using DMA-based communication instead of TCP for higher performance. All of this is to reduce network contention.<p>Suppose there&#x27;s 1GB&#x2F;s of network traffic for each node. (High-end clusters use InfiniBand to get this performance.) In order to have a backup handy, all of that data for each node needs to be replicated somewhere. That&#x27;s more network traffic. Presumable there are many fewer spare nodes than real nodes, since otherwise that&#x27;s a lot of expensive hardware that&#x27;s only rarely used. If there are 512 real nodes and 1 backup node, than that backup node has to handle 512GB&#x2F;second. Of course, the backup node can die, so you really want to have several nodes, each with a huge amount of bandwidth.<p>Even then, the messages only exchange part of the state data. For example, in a spatial decomposition, each node might handle (say) 1,000 cells of a larger grid. The contents of a cell can interact with each other, and with the contents of its neighbor cells, up to some small radius away. (For simplicity, assume the radius is only one cell away, so there are 26 neighbors for each cell.)<p>If one node hosts one cell and another node hosts another then at each step they will have to exchange cell contents, in order to compute the interactions. This requires network overhead.<p>On the other hand, a good spatial decomposition will minimize the amount of network traffic by putting most neighbors on the same machine. After all, memory bandwidth is higher than network, and doesn&#x27;t have the same contention issues.<p>But this means that the node has mutating state which isn&#x27;t easily observed by recording and replaying the network. Instead, the backup node needs to get a complete state update of the entire system.<p>This is a checkpoint. But notice that I used a spatial decomposition to minimize network usage by <i>not</i> sending all of the data all of the time? I&#x27;ve thrown that out of the window. Now I need to checkpoint all of the time, and have the ability to replay the network requests that the node is involved in, should it go down.<p>This is complicated, and will likely exceed what the hardware can do, given that it&#x27;s already using high-end hardware for the normal operations."
"Yeah true. Though one way it could play out is that the existing behemoths transition from a centralized company structure to a decentralized algorithmic structure to save costs.<p>If the &quot;boring&quot; functions of big tech companies can be automated, at some point it makes sense to just spin that out into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) aka smart contract&#x2F;s on a platform like Ethereum. The company still receives the tiny transaction fee from that running contract, but they don&#x27;t need any employees&#x2F;infrastructure&#x2F;costs so overall revenue wouldn&#x27;t be affected from the change.<p>Consumer-facing nothing will have changed. Same apps, same beautiful interfaces. But 99% of the backend business operations will be performed by distributed, decentralized algorithms running on a blockchain.<p>Particularly as the sharing economy unicorns scale (Uber, Airbnb etc) they are essentially becoming the single interface and algorithm to entire industries. Uber will become the single monopolized UI to the entirety of all transport (people&#x2F;food&#x2F;parcels) with some other minor competitors.<p>But Uber can very easily be decentralized. And actually the bigger they get, the easier it will be to decentralize them as a third party (because the trained workforce and behaviour is established, and will gravitate on economics... lower prices, higher wages). And so <i></i>hopefully<i></i> the costs, competition, monopoly legal issues and scaling pressures (at 1B+ users) will encourage Uber itself to decentralize and run their entire operations transparently on a blockchain.<p>Maybe in some other capacity Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Amazon will follow suit.

"The authors mention the problem of capacity increases in storage outpacing bandwidth growth.<p>This is mathematical inevitability at least for spinning disks, as long as capacity increases come from density increases.  When density increases by a factor n, capacity increases by n^2, because the disk surface is two-dimensional.  OTOH, the tracks under the head are linear, so the same density improvement of factor n only causes a corresponding bandwidth increase of factor n.<p>And seek times are governed by physics and haven&#x27;t really improved much at all.

"&gt; I&#x27;m acutely aware of how much does or does not go into textures. Modern shaders can account for as much as half of rendering time, with tracing of rays accounting for the other half. This is the entire shader, not just textures and is an extreme example.<p>At least at VFX level (Pixar&#x27;s slightly different, as they use a lot of procedural textures), Texture I&#x2F;O time can be a significant amount of render time.<p>&gt; This is not true at all. Render farm nodes are typically built with memory to CPU core ratios that match as the main priority.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by this (I assume that memory scales with cores?), but most render farms at high level have extremely expensive fast I&#x2F;O caches very close to the render server nodes (usually Avere solutions) mainly just for the textures.<p>The raw source textures are normally of the order of hundreds of gigabytes and thus have to be out-of-core. Pulling them off disk, uncompressing them and filtering them (even tiled and pre-mipped) is extremely expensive.<p>&gt; This is also not true. In 1995 an Onyx with a maximum of 32 _Sockets_ had a maximum of 2GB of memory. The bandwidth to PCIe 3.0 16x is about 16GB&#x2F;s and plenty of cards already have 16GB of memory. The textures would also stay in memory for multiple frames, since most textures are not animated.<p>This <i>is</i> true. One of the reasons why GPU renderers still aren&#x27;t being used at high-level VFX in general is precisely because of both memory limits (once you go out-of-core on a GPU, you might as well have stayed on the CPU) and due to PCI transfer costs of getting the stuff onto the GPU.<p>On top of that, almost all final rendering is still done on a per-frame basis, so for each frame, you start the renderer, give it the source scene&#x2F;geo, it then loads the textures again and again for each different frame - precisely <i>why</i> fast Texture caches are needed."

"You have any sources for that?<p>&quot;GPS satellites revolve around the earth with a velocity of 3.874 km&#x2F;s at an altitude of 20,184 km. Thus on account of the its velocity, a satellite clock appears to run slow by 7 microseconds per day when compared to a clock on the earth’s surface. But on account of the difference in gravitational potential, the satellite clock appears to run fast by 45 microseconds per day. The net effect is that the clock appears to run fast by 38 microseconds per day. This is an enormous rate difference for an atomic clock with a precision of a few nanoseconds. Thus to compensate for this large secular rate, the clocks are given a rate offset prior to satellite launch of - 4.465 parts in 1010 from their nominal frequency of 10.23 MHz so that on average they appear to run at the same rate as a clock on the ground. The actual frequency of the satellite clocks before launch is thus 10.22999999543 MHz.<p>Although the GPS satellite orbits are nominally circular, there is always some residual eccentricity. The eccentricity causes the orbit to be slightly elliptical, and the velocity and altitude vary over one revolution. Thus, although the principal velocity and gravitational effects have been compensated by a rate offset, there remains a slight residual variation that is proportional to the eccentricity. For example, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.02 there is a relativistic sinusoidal variation in the apparent clock time having an amplitude of 46 nanoseconds. This correction must be calculated and taken into account in the GPS receiver.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve had a chance to speak with a few engineers from Motorola that worked on GPS and a very interesting fellow that worked on GLONASS all of them said that they had a tuned atomic clock and everything was done on the receiving end and for the most part the clocks on the satellites could not be even corrected after they were initialized."

It is extremely important when you have 64 cores orif you use wide SIMD instructions. Intel&#x27;s Xeon Phi have 16GB HMC memory with 500GB&#x2F;s bandwidth to prevent the CPUs from being starved by main memory.<p>Imagine you have a cache miss on literally every memory access and have to pay a 100 nano second penalty to access main memory. SMT allows the CPU to switch to a different thread during a cache miss. Effectively you can have 128 memory loads at any given time. 100ns amortized over 128 threads is less than 1 nano second. Since the minimum size you can read is a 64 byte cache line this means that program will require at least 64GB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth even though your CPU is stuck on cache misses.

Your workload was probably issuing the writes in chunks smaller than the flash memory&#x27;s page size (typically 16kB these days), so you probably had serious write amplification from the read-modify-write cycles even if that 80kB&#x2F;s was sequential writes.

"I&#x27;ve read a lot about different advanced data structures for text editing, but in my experience the reality is that, with memory bandwidths and CPU speeds being what they are today, and the speed at which human inputs occur, one big linear buffer is the simplest way to do it and the performance is not as bad as you&#x27;d think --- indeed it seems inefficient to be moving blocks of memory up to the whole size of the file whenever you insert a character, but when you consider that ~30CPS is the fastest input rate you&#x27;re likely to encounter for individual single-character inserts (keyboard autorepeat), and that a modern CPU can memmove() at &gt;1GB&#x2F;s, you are unlikely to notice any difference in performance until the file you&#x27;re editing is several tens of MB; and that is a relatively rare use-case (large files are usually opened not for actual editing, but for browsing and searching --- like logs. In that case, the overhead of constructing a more complex datastructure upon open may actually be slower.)<p>Even PCs in the DOS era with memory bandwidths in the single-digit MB&#x2F;s range were OK with text editors that use a linear buffer, simply because people didn&#x27;t really edit nor generate huge text files very often (&quot;huge&quot; being more than several hundred KB.)"

"I own a 4k @ 60Hz monitor. If I were to buy a laptop, I&#x27;d like to connect it and a bunch of USB devices via a single USB C cable. Easy, right?<p>Except that the monitor only supports DisplayPort 1.2. 4k60 requires a bandwidth of 12.54 Gbit&#x2F;s. DP 1.2 consists of four data lanes, each providing 4.32 GBit&#x2F;s, so my monitor requires four full lanes. DP 1.3 and up provide at least 7.48 Gbit&#x2F;s, so 4k60 would only require two lanes for that.<p>USB C consists of 4 data lanes. When using the DisplayPort alternate mode, it can assign either 1, 2, or 4 data lanes to DP. The other lanes can be used for USB. In addition to that, it also offers a single USB 2.0 lane.<p>If a dock - even an expensive one - supports a resolution of 4k60 via DP and provides USB 3 ports, will it actually work for me? It could use DP 1.2 by assigning four data links to DP , but that means USB gets downgraded to 2.0 and I don&#x27;t think any hub actually supports this. It could use DP 1.3+ and assign two data links to DP and two to USB, but if it outputs that same DP signal, it won&#x27;t provide the bandwidth my monitor needs so it must actively convert two-link DP 1.3 to four-link DP 1.2. Again, I don&#x27;t think any hub actually supports this.<p>The hardware I need can definitely exist. It&#x27;s a pretty normal thing to ask for. A lot of docks, even the expensive ones, will claim to support what I need, but as far as I can tell not a single dock actually can. Because USB C has so many protocol options, figuring out what is supported has become nearly impossible."

Whole world should transform to produce only SAAS products for SAAS people as they are the only customers who will in long term still have money to buy SAAS. &#x2F;s<p>This is becoming a joke.<p>In my whole life I didnt buy a one single software product, that is based on subscription model (unless necessary as there are ongoing costs for its development like antiviruses (which I dont use, but this is another story)). Why? As it tells me, the product is at the end of its inovative phase and has nothing more to offer. I am fine with paying for update hunderds of dollars if, and only if, i need the added functionality. Or in different words Microsoft Office 97 was more than enough for 99% of its users (I dare you to install it and find something that you miss, it wasn&#x27;t perfect but it did get the job done).<p>But there is more. I wont pay for cloud products either. Why? I believe that what is giving you the &quot;edge&quot; is your knowlidge. Using, for instance, gmail is taking you the chance to increase it. Yeah sure, time to market, but if you stick to DIY logic, this is not going to be a problem (I can set up a mail server with left hand while coding with right hand... and offer it as a SAAS to those that ignore DIY and earn extra bucks ;) &#x2F;s ). If you ignore the lack of knowlidge, you will end up always paying to someone else or stuck in a problem that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you wouldn&#x27;t be ignoring it for so long.

"This is not a language issue, but programmers who have made a mistake. The same thing would happen if an assembly programmer were not to set the correct registers or push all the arguments to the stack before calling an other function. The same thing would happen in most languages if a programmer declared their FFI incorrectly.<p>So Programmer&#x2F;s have written function prototypes for the Fortran functions, but they have omitted the length parameter in that prototype. That is the reason behind this. It should have never worked to begin with but the way it was handled on the FORTRAN side things meant for single length strings it did not crash. GCC probably could have just made the change they wanted, but they don&#x27;t want to break existing code right away that is technically already broken.<p>It boils down to some programmer&#x2F;s doing the following.<p>int foo(char <i>str);<p>instead of<p>int foo(char </i>str, int len); &#x2F;&#x2F; The correct prototype.<p>The prototype is you saying there is a function that exists with this name, return type and parameters.

Then when linking the linker just looks at the name of the called function and replaces it with the address&#x2F;memory position of the function."
"In gaming, the concept is called a &quot;replay&quot;, where instead of recording the pixels on the screen in every frame, they instead record all inputs processed on every frame, and just replay them thru the same engine.

If your game patched the &quot;jump&quot; function to increase upward momentum from 1.1 m&#x2F;s to 1.13 m&#x2F;s, the Replay would be incorrect. You would be jumping onto platforms you couldn&#x27;t get up to before, moving faster, maybe even dodging enemy attacks that hit you when you played that match.<p>The human neuroprocessor is always changing and growing, always revising itself.

"The economics are simple - how much power do you use vs how much money you make per unit time. As a miner you&#x27;re banking on the increase in difficulty correlating with an increase in price.

Combine this with the ability for a microwave link to have a shorter path than optical fibre, and it&#x27;s easy to see why a microwave link can be lower latency.<p>Nobody is disputing the fact that fibre optic can handle much higher bandwidths, but that is irrelevant in this application. The amount of data required to make a trade is probably in the order of kiloBytes or MegaBytes, easily handled by the few Gbps limit of microwave links.<p>The reason why satellite internet is so terrible is because a geostationary satellite sits 22,236 miles above the surface of the earth.

And you could forget about 4K content. Miraculously, when an Xfinity app was installed on ROKU which required a supplemental CATV account, which conveniently Xfinity marketed at a 2 yr. super discount to undercut the DirectTV app package, the internet speeds increased from a throttled 5 to a consistent 15MB&#x2F;s on non-VPN downloads (using IDM on Win7, similar results in Linux Mint).

"Colleague of the author here.<p>I guess that 4450 requests&#x2F;s to one IP, or even spread across multiple IPs, could trigger some alarms if the victim is alert. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not that familiar with IDS&#x2F;IPS&#x27;s to answer that with much confidence.<p>In any case, an attacker has a lot of options. The requests do not need to be made sequentially, so an attacker could basically start and resume his attack whenever he wants, e.g. when the victim is away from keyboard (which he can estimate based on the network traffic someone usually generates). An attacker could also simply slow down the number of requests&#x2F;s, although this results in a larger number of hours required for a successful attack.<p>As for energy&#x2F;CPU consumption, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;d be a big concern.

The only thing I can imagine someone doing personally is video, and it would have to be a <i>lot</i> of video like some kind of long-running documentary project that you are producing in your spare time.<p>The other factor is to be more paranoid about mixing tape generations than the vendors suggest. Ignore the specs and stick to same-generation media and drives.<p>Efficiently writing to a tape means filling e.g. a 20 MB&#x2F;s write channel for LTO-6, or 750 MB&#x2F;s for LTO-8.

"Where is that micrometer mounted?  The problem you&#x27;re going to have (which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware of) is that if it&#x27;s after the freeze bath, you&#x27;re miles away from where the thickness is actually determined.  If the speed of the rollers makes the filament go through the bath at 1m&#x2F;s (say) and the bath is 2m long, you can&#x27;t react to any deviation in the temperature of the plastic as it leaves the nozzle (for instance) any sooner than 2 seconds later, and any drift has had that long to cause a problem.  That way lies an oscillating system, unless you&#x27;re quite careful.<p>The way you&#x27;ve posed the system, my gut feeling is that your problems are going to come down to reaction time.  Once a problem manifests in the system, how quickly can you a) detect it; b) react; and c) have that reaction take effect?<p>There are three things I&#x27;d look at.  The first is to make sure the entire path of the plastic until it has set is tightly temperature-controlled.  You can&#x27;t have breezes varying the temperature of the plastic before it enters the bath, so you want a PID-controlled warming tube to control its descent into the bath.  Similarly you need to control the temperature, depth, and turbidity of the bath so that the length of time the plastic is less-than-fully-solid is tightly controlled.  If you do that, you&#x27;ve got a chance that you&#x27;ve controlled the physics of the filament well enough that quick deviations will be damped out, and slow drifts get picked up by the micrometer.<p>The second is mounting the micrometer as close to where the filament enters the bath as you can get it.  That&#x27;s the point that&#x27;s as close as you can get to where the plastic&#x27;s frozen and the thickness is determined, so there&#x27;s as little lag as possible between where you&#x27;re measuring and where you&#x27;re having an effect.  That will let the system react to much faster deviations than it would be able to otherwise.<p>Third, I&#x27;d make that bath as short as possible.  The length of filament hanging in the bath will act like a spring, so when the rollers speed up to try to thin the filament out, that acceleration will be blunted as the filament lifts up into a shallower catenary.  You can compensate for this in the control system, but it&#x27;s better not to have to.  In fact, if you could get rid of the need for a bath by instead rolling the filament immediately onto a chilled metal roller close to the extruder die, that might open up other possibilities, but that ends up baking stresses into the filament which you might not want to deal with."

"You are ignoring the fact that it&#x27;s not just mobile devices that take advantage of fast mobile data connections. Being able to bring a LTE hotspot on long out-of-home stays is pretty nice, and while you may not want to do big downloads on your phone or watch 1080p videos on a screen with less vertical resolution than that, you may want to do so on your laptop.<p>If for you 4G is only slightly faster than 3G, then blame your service provider, because it&#x27;s not supposed to. Where I live (Portugal) I get 2-7 Mbit&#x2F;s speeds with 3G and 10-40 Mbit&#x2F;s speeds with 4G. But most importantly, I was getting 100 ms pings with 3G while 4G pings are more like 20 ms. Or perhaps your service provider is limiting LTE usage to phones and forbidding tethering, which is silly too.<p>LTE is, right now, the only way to even get proper Internet connections on rural areas, where the alternative is DSL with speeds below 1 Mbit&#x2F;s, and sometimes not even that. I believe it&#x27;s also much cheaper for the network operators to cover those areas with wireless Internet than by laying copper, let alone fiber.<p>The main issue, that can&#x27;t be stressed enough, is indeed the data caps. As things are now, higher speeds only lead to hitting the limits in less time. Worse, some sites now seem to detect faster connections and deliver more&#x2F;heavier content over these (<i>cough</i> YouTube in auto quality mode <i>cough</i>), completely ignoring that a faster connection may still have caps. But I have no doubt there are uses for having fiber-like experiences over wireless broadband, especially if the latency is reduced (IMO more important than increasing the speed)."

I expect that&#x27;s mostly because local governments in Australia are far less powerful than in the United States (which, for the most part, I&#x27;m actually okay with) and wouldn&#x27;t be able to raise taxes and spend them on broadband projects. The Australian Capital Territory, of course, is a special case - a local government with state-level powers, who already owned an electricity network when they decided to go into FTTN as well."

The number of rows&#x2F;seconds mainly depends on the number and types of columns that are accessed. For example, if we scan 1.8B rows and only load a single integer column from disk (and the integers are small), we&#x27;ll only have to load about 1 byte per row from disk (using an idealized model excluding some overheads for illustration purposes). If we want to complete the query in 1.5 seconds that would be a total IO load of 1144MB&#x2F;s. So (depending on disk speed) around ~15 machines would suffice."

But until that happens, Consol will be, IMHO, a very shiny ghetto. Because of the break with traditional tools, it will be hard to build a user base because of a reverse network effect- I can&#x27;t use Consol effectively until other user&#x27;s signup as well. IMHO that hurdle can only be cleared by signing up whole teams, not individual users.<p>I would recommend tighter integration with existing services but that does not seem to be compatible with end-to-end encryption. Perhaps it would be helpful to introduce a migration tool for acclimating new users.<p>TL;DR A nice tool IFF you whole team migrates at once and you can make a clean break with the past."

"Utility regulation in the U.S. is steeped in New Deal ideas from back when we didn&#x27;t understand how economics worked. Did you know that in the New Deal era, competition was considered a bad thing, so companies had to get permission from the government before building new infrastructure because it might create competition? There&#x27;s still tons of that in the Communications Act. For example, 47 U.S.C. 214.<p>What&#x27;s really telling is that while many in the U.S. want more utility-style regulation, Europe is actively getting away from it. For example, our universal service cross-subsidy system is an antediluvian throwback compared to Sweden (tax credit of about $600 for rural folks to build their own fiber).<p>If you built airplanes the way U.S. municipal entities regulate utilities, government officials would just declare the acceleration of gravity to be 2.5 m&#x2F;s&#x2F;s and pat themselves on the back for basically having solved the problem. Not only do municipal-level regulators not really understand the underlying economics of the system, but they don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re dealing with an economic system. They don&#x27;t understand that the economy that cannot simply be moved a desired end state by legislative fiat, but rather takes legislation as an input into an economic process that produces an equilibrium state that might include many unintended consequences, and may not include the desired end state at all. This is a problem with regulators generally, but is particularly a problem in the U.S. In Europe, things like telecom regulation are handled at the national level by the most sophisticated regulators and economists. In the U.S., most important telecom decisions are made by generalist municipal bodies, who have little understanding of these issues."

I have been reading a lot of these comments here and some of the people who ran into issues just sound like they don&#x27;t understand what they were using or building. As many have said before opentsdb is great if you understand all of your components. Hbase is somewhat of a black art. You also truly need to understand your data. You cannot just start writing data and when it fails be upset with the product. Opentsdb is no silver bullet to the metrics game but it sure as hell is better than most at a larger scale.<p>We are doing right now roughly 1.2m&#x2F;s and will likely grow to 6-8 depending on how we chop this up. Either way you have to use any level of intelligence with this product as you do with others. I cannot stress this enough but plan out your data. Make sure you are very strict with the pattern of how things get written and the amount of tags you allow. No datapoint will initially make sense for you you may have to shift things around a bit. There is an active PR collectd that addresses metric mapping which can be very beneficial to high throughout shops.<p>Either way just make sure you know what you are getting into and understand your problem as well as your product you are choosing. Opentsdb could be overkill for people who just want a low amount of data per second. You will also need to plan retention policies &#x2F; long term storage &#x2F; hardware requirements &#x2F; etc. remember you are running hbase.

"Articles like this feel awfully fuzzy when it comes to how they suggest VG is in some kind of &quot;race&quot; with actual orbital companies. I&#x27;m just not seeing the path from A to B for VG&#x27;s current efforts there, and without that I&#x27;m also not seeing what their future is at all?<p>&gt;<i>The company said the space ship&#x27;s motor burned for 60 seconds, travelling at 2.9 times the speed of sound as it gained height.</i><p>So they managed to briefly beat the Concorde (top speed a bit of Mach 2) and are still well under half the speed of the X-15? I mean, good for them I guess but it seems pretty ridiculous to put VG in even vaguely the same game as anybody doing actual orbital work (not just SpaceX or BO but smaller outfits even). Mach 2.9 isn&#x27;t even 1 km&#x2F;s, and LEO average orbital is more like 7.8 km&#x2F;s (and required delta-v for that will likely be at least a good extra 1.5 km&#x2F;s over that accounting for drag&#x2F;grav). Yes &quot;space&quot; may start at 100 km as the atmosphere drops sufficiently, but I think what most people think about when it comes to &quot;going to space&quot; and doing something useful involves <i>orbit</i>, even for tourism purposes (orbital space hotels say). The challenges of every bit of it, from delta-v to heating to in-orbit survival is all on an entirely different plane.<p>Meanwhile with the BFR it looks quite possibly that SpaceX may well drop below $500&#x2F;kg to LEO, possibly by a lot. They claim to be aiming for $10m a flight which would be more like sub-$100&#x2F;kg, but I take that as more a long term aspirational goal approaching the costs of fuel a minimal maintenance then anything in the immediately realizable future. But even a conservative guess of more like $40m would still mean being able to get people into real orbit for less money then VG&#x27;s up-and-down. BO is pursuing similar cost economics, and both are fighting through the very hard R&amp;D work in actually getting scalable long term cost reductions like methalox working right now.<p>Can anyone explain what if anything about VG&#x27;s current R&amp;D would actually carry over to a real spacecraft, or what they use case for it would be if it can&#x27;t reach that? For merely going very high and very fast on Earth low boom supersonic R&amp;D seems more promising, and for actual space, well this isn&#x27;t it. What am I missing here?"

"All the problems you present go into the category of sharing state. This is the unique problem presented by concurrent programming, which is no harder than all the other problems in programming. This does not mean that concurrent programming is <i>hard</i>, but that just like <i>all other programming</i>, it has some sharp edges.<p>The issues related to sharing state can be easily avoided by, for example, using a CSP-style paradigm (channels in Go). In Go, this only leaves behind a deadlock, which are automatically panic, making it incredibly easy to debug.<p>Overhead of scheduling and effects on optimizers are not related to concurrency&#x2F;parallelism. The scheduler is affected by many things even under single-threaded execution which is far beyond the scope of normal application developers, and optimizers are largely unaffected by concurrent&#x2F;parallel programming (although shared structures must internally present memory barriers). The optimizer is also beyond the scope of normal application development.<p>If you are doing development that requires precise control over optimizations and scheduling (like I do), then all bets are off.<p>However, with &quot;normal&quot; (i.e. not-processing-8x100Gb&#x2F;s streams) programming, concurrent programming is a breeze unless you intentionally shoot yourself in the foot."

"I mean, its a rumor, so I&#x27;m pretty much pretending that Navi will be either slower than that, or cost more than $300. Rumor is that AMD had issues figuring out how to architecture chiplets into GPUs.<p>CPUs have a long-history of NUMA &#x2F; multiple sockets. GPUs history of &quot;Crossfire&quot; and other such technologies is far weaker and has far worse support. It is less clear how software is supposed to represent asymmetric access to memory.<p>How do you build a GPU with a single view of memory, when each die is likely connected to its own set of RAM? Especially with latency being as big of an issue as it is already.<p>I&#x27;m sure AMD is working on the problem, but I don&#x27;t personally expect it to be solved so soon. Yeah, AMD Infinity Fabric is a nifty 50GB&#x2F;s chiplet bus. But HBM2 is 1TBps, so Infinity Fabric is simply too slow to share data between hypothetical GPU chiplets."

If your buying these machines with multiple TB of RAM, then buying flash arrays that can drive multiple GB&#x2F;sec of IO bandwidth shouldn&#x27;t be a problem either. At say 8GB&#x2F;sec write bandwidth flushing 1TB is a little over two minutes. Although, why you have that much &quot;dirty&quot; data in RAM might be another question. A database machine using that amount of RAM is going to care more about the IOP rates of the disk, so that its flushing updates to disk at the same rates they are arriving. Meaning that the RAM won&#x27;t need to be flushed to disk if the machine&#x2F;power&#x2F;whatever fails. Disk arrays with &gt;1M IOP&#x2F;s have been around for over a decade, and given a SAN can be wired together to increase aggregate performance."

"I think this is correct.<p>With 24X NVMe servers now common and cheap (AMD EPYC) you can get 96GB&#x2F;s (theoretical max, and real is not far off) onto NVMe which is same order of magnitude as memory bandwidth.<p>When PCI-e 4 comes out next year the bandwidth will double and SSD manufacturers will have no problem doubling the performance of NVMe devices once the interface supports it so at that point the bandwidth on NVMe will surpass RAM.<p>The major caveat is that sequential read&#x2F;write is much faster than random (this can be offset to a certain extent if you can queue up many random requests at the same time but each random request has a very high latency) so I would expect that switching from 4K to 2MB pages would have significant advantages on the storage side beyond efficiencies gained in the kernel."

For systems where you only want to handle a fixed number of connections like databases you keep your number of threads fixed for others you start a new thread once every other thread handles a connection already. It gets rid of Thread Pools (since you only do pthread_create() when your number of concurrent connections increases), Async- and callback-hell and makes all your handling code linear.<p>Every other day I keep seeing &quot;Blabla uses async epoll so handles 10k connections&quot; but a) what serious work can you do with 10k connections i.e. 125 kB&#x2F;s per connection @ 10 Gbit&#x2F;s. b) at what cost to readability&#x2F;maintainability of code and c) are you sure you haven&#x27;t just moved your bottleneck to something else?

"The 1Gb per Tb rule of thumb is to handle the larger requirements of ARC caching, not the FS itself.<p>It&#x27;s a performance guide, not a requirement.<p>The Gb&#x2F;TB rule of thumb exists so that on-disk files can be moved around or stored in RAM before a write operation, and that open or recent files can be precached in RAM while being streamed, more than it is relative to the pools total capacity.<p>For things like compression, hashing, encryption, block defragmenting and other operations,     ZFS uses a lot of caching and indexing to avoid bottlenecks.<p>If Apple decides to implement APFS on RAID at a software level ie to combat bitrot or to sell consumer &#x2F;business NAS &#x2F; SAN ie upscaled Time Machine services for VMs, there&#x27;s going to be questionable setups and comparisons to FreeNAS, synology, unRAID and other software storage options with a mixture of technology and hardware, where apple won&#x27;t be flexible or adaptive.<p>To argue for ZFS, requires understanding more about ZFS usage and performance scenarios.<p>It is very possible to run ZFS RAID Z1 on 2gb or less for even a 32tb pool, ie anyone is able to run 5x seagate 8tb SMR archive drives in RAID Z1, on 2gb RAM.<p>It is usable. FreeNAS regularly hosts builds on less than optimal hardware setups,<p>It&#x27;s also usable with 4gb, 8gb, 16gb, or 32gb RAM, with varying % performance benefits as features are enabled and cache is expanded to handle storage of ARC or LRU (recently used) files&#x2F;pages&#x2F;blocks.<p>Usually, ZFS metric is measured in throughput when empty, to 90% full, and performance changes drastically under these conditions when cache is limited.<p>On a system like this with SMR &quot;archive&quot; drives the problem often is having a reliable cache of write data, and ideally, less fragments to store asynchronously, ie writing large files or modifying a large block is disk IO limited. If being used to store archives, up to and including for media files as a consumer device would, an optimal RAM size would be hard to guess, given that people might store bluray or UHD ISO files of ~40gb versus DVD&#x27;s of 4-9gb, and streaming read&#x2F;write of linear files would not use significant random iops.<p>With DB or VM storage, and consistent file blocks being written, the use case and performance requirements are just going to be different again, and this is where the 1gb per Tb rule is both useful and unhelpful for diagnosis of requirements.<p>ZFS has a lot of bottlenecks, usually CPU, RAM and IOPS, but people focus on RAM, since it is so much harder to expand or scale. And, it is not linear scale performance.<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s just impossible to guess optimal use in a practical way since there&#x27;s almost no caching at all under 2gb, the ARC is very limited and kernel panics are possible when memory is not tuned or limited to avoid expansion, which then usually relies on CPU performance rather than disk performance.<p>At the high end of usage, performance can be managed by different methods such as L2ARC, ZIL, more RAM, more CPU, different pools, etc. Each with caveats and usually, non linear benefits.<p>Many NAS units that come with 2gb of RAM are capable of running ZFS, the problem is performance.<p>It&#x27;s even possible to run ZFS on less than 1gb RAM, but it&#x27;s not going to be reliable or predictable unless you restrict the conditions of usage, ie limiting max filesizes, restrictions on vdevs or iops, etc. It would require heavy tuning for optimal task usage.<p>Especially if you start to hit the maximum storage limits of the pool, performance can be brutal without caching features, lower than 100kb&#x2F;s when the ARC is busy or unoptimised. Usually whatever the CPU can deliver from the drive IO without IO or file cache will be veeery slow on NAS level hardware, because traditional NAS isn&#x27;t CPU bound.<p>Essentially, at the point where you can&#x27;t start or run performance features, there&#x27;s no benefit from ZFS or CoW on smaller embed devices unless it is needed.<p>From memory, and experience, you can use half a gb per Tb of storage on Z1 storage with some caveats and have a usable performance, as long as you keep filesize and IO in mind.<p>With 4tb or larger drives, Z2 is recommended due to the outcome of a drive failure on the pool integrity, and just the rebuild &#x2F;resilver times and error probability could allow data to be changed or corrupted during the resilver process.<p>This is just to combat entropy when reading Tb of data and creating new checksums due to the probabilities involved with magnetic storage. Current and future drive density almost guarantees that errors will occur with entropy and decay of magnetic storage.<p>With deduplication, it needs to store files with multiple hashes, caches per device, and pool, which conflates sizes (sic). About 5gb per Tb is a good start. in most cases, you would never require dedup as it has an extreme cost and usage case."

"I have a really hard time with the idea that there is this thing called Architecture and it is separate from some other property or activity like Code&#x2F;Coding.<p>If you show me the implementation of a low-level component (a file, class, namespace - depending on your design idioms and PL) in your system... basically, a set of functions&#x2F;methods organized and composed into a whole -- then I can tell you if you have an Architect on your hands.<p>For any business offering (any system&#x2F;product line) the skill set required to factor this into a decoupled&#x2F;maintainable whole is the <i>same skillset</i> required to compose a lower level subsystem or component.<p>(Granted there is typically some knowledge&#x2F;experience at the higher level system required --eg, around database systems&#x2F;tradeoffs&#x2F;theory, distributed system tools&#x2F;properties&#x2F;theory, etc -- but the core skillset of <i>factoring</i> is the same.)<p>If you can&#x27;t decouple a component into set of compose-able functions serving some component contract (I call this <i>coding</i> by the way), then you should not be trusted to compose an architecture for a system&#x2F;offering. Similarly if you can do this decoupling at the low level and do it well, then you can do it at the higher level -- again, assuming you have experience and are familiar with the data structures typically found at those higher levels (queues, dbs, coordinators, stream processors, etc).<p>There&#x27;s a single fundamental skillset. It&#x27;s the ability to instinctive decouple a system -- any system at any level -- into proper parts.<p>One might say - well, an Architect is someone with this skillset. The non-Architects, the Juniors can be left to code up the smaller pieces, where problems stemming from their lack of skill can at least be marginalized.<p>This is weakly true and a simplistic view, however. Because decisions made at lower levels can have permeating effects quite rapidly. Another way to put this is that as one problem-solves within an overall system architecture, one encounters novelty on the regular, so to speak. And the solution&#x2F;s to this or that novelty has to be slotted <i>first</i> at the right level of the system... in one instant, you will find that the top-level systems need a slight adjustment to accommodate things, in another you&#x27;ll find that nothing needs to be perturbed above the component at hand.<p>If you say the Junior needs to tap the Architect&#x27;s shoulder in each such instance, then you&#x27;ll find quickly that this is pointless and the Architect would do better to write some code.<p>You either have people with the skillset or you don&#x27;t. If the skillset is there, the architecture will be organically established. If the skillset is absent, whether you have an Architect in title bears less on the technical quality of your system but you may get a win on the team&#x2F;organizational side of things."
"You aren&#x27;t going to be able to build a super-fast CPU on an FPGA but there are plenty of other tasks you could give it. You can build a processor for analyze multiple sensors, looking for specific events that you could then feed to the uC or setup a DSP pipeline to filter the sensor data to look for patterns. The nice thing about an FPGA is that there is no interruption when it&#x27;s running. The uC might be trying to feed data over wifi to the controller station and polling sensors&#x2F;analyzing sensor data is going to bog things down really quick. Another task for an FPGA would be to act as a switch for a network within the robot. It would sit between all of the sensors&#x2F;actuators and an ethernet-enabled uC located elsewhere in the robot. The FPGA would read command packets from the uC and translate tasks like &quot;read temperature sensor #5&quot; or &quot;turn 15 degrees&quot; into specific impulses on the pins while also turning sensor and feedback data into packets to send back to the uC. You could even run video feeds from cameras back to the uC over gigabit if the FPGA supports it. This way you can run a cheap, small uC to control things from a higher level while the i&#x2F;o-plentiful FPGA does all the heavy lifting at 100Mb&#x2F;s speeds."

"I don&#x27;t get it. A linker&#x27;s task should be straightforward. In essence, it looks up addresses from strings, whose number is bounded by the lines of code written by humans.

Not that that&#x27;s a huge number in terms of today&#x27;s computing power, but how many millions of lines of source code does that correspond to?<p>Still, 1M relocations, or 34MB of &quot;Reloc&quot; objects, as indicated, shouldn&#x27;t be a huge issue to process. Object files should have minimal parsing overhead. Is there any indication how long this takes to link? Shouldn&#x27;t 1 or 2 secs be sufficient?

"The engineering required for an orbital launch gun is beyond the scale of anything yet built.<p>Let&#x27;s say, for the sake of argument, that your space gun&#x27;s acceleration track climbs the slopes of Chimborazo in Ecuador and releases the launch vehicle at the summit.<p>From there, if you launch eastward, you get about 460 m&#x2F;s for free from the rotation of the Earth near the equator.  LEO requires about 7800 m&#x2F;s.  Earth escape requires about 11180 m&#x2F;s from that altitude.<p>So if you go to LEO, you need another 7340 m&#x2F;s of velocity.  If you accelerate at 3 g, your track needs to be 920 km long.  That isn&#x27;t quite the distance from the end of your track to the Galapagos Islands.<p>The same length of track could hit escape velocity with constant acceleration at 6.5 g.<p>For reference, the Large Hadron Collider is 27 km in circumference, and cost about $5 billion.  A space gun would be 34 times longer, and portions of it would have to be evacuated and neutrally buoyant at some depth under the ocean.  The entire length would need to be powered.<p>If you built a circular track 920 km in circumference, 147 km radius, the centripetal acceleration required to keep something moving at 7340 m&#x2F;s on that track would be more than 37 g.  That only increases as you reduce the radius.  So no getting away with a shorter track."

Just the amounts that Google&#x2F;FB&#x2F;AWS etc push between continents is more than a satellite link could sustain.<p>For latency sensitive applications (e.g. finance, video links), starlink can indeed be a good alternative but it won&#x27;t replace backbones, e.g. distribution of youtube videos to edge locations around the world."

"Some thoughts.<p>First, I work with various companies, many of which have remote work options. These options range from a couple days&#x2F;week remote, to 100% remote.  What I&#x27;m hearing from employees at the companies which have remote work implemented is they don&#x27;t want to work for a company which doesn&#x27;t offer remote work at the same level or better as their current employer. And the more time spent working away from the office, the more adamant the employees are about this.<p>And these employees aren&#x27;t only technologists either.  I&#x27;m hearing the same thing from accounting, marketing, etc department employees who get a taste of remote work, and really don&#x27;t want to go back to butts-in-seats. And their reasons are similar to the tech side--productivity goes up, no commute, fewer meetings and annoying co-workers.<p>Second, there are very few technical reasons (I won&#x27;t say none) that a company can&#x27;t enable remote workers and save a ton on real estate costs.  Skype, Google Hangouts, Facetime and even WebRTC (even in it&#x27;s current state), show that individual&#x2F;team-based video collaboration is possible over commonly available 20-50 Mb&#x2F;s connections. VoIP enables an employee&#x27;s &quot;desk phone&quot; to follow them anywhere (I was doing this with a headset&#x2F;laptop&#x2F;VPN in 2001).  Chat is heavily used, even in the &quot;business side&quot; (accounting, etc) for traceability.<p>The main technical problem is still reliable bandwidth.  Even though 20-50 Mb&#x2F;s suffices, 100 Mb&#x2F;s or even 1 Gb&#x2F;s active fiber would be better, to achieve corporate LAN-like speeds at home.  Around this region, FTTP-enabled homes are selling like hotcakes.<p>Finally, with the advent of &quot;The Cloud&quot; or just plain old-fashioned datacenter hosting, there&#x27;s really no difference between working in a cube or working from home. Everything&#x27;s already remote.  In this sense, many corporate employees--with systems and co-workers located in another building&#x2F;city&#x2F;country--have a huge head start on this compared to start-up employees."

I have 50 GB or so of music at 260 Kbit&#x2F;s AAC.  If I were to use FLAC instead, I would need 140 GB of storage.  Practically speaking, for a MacBook this means going to the 512 GB storage model instead of the 256 GB storage model, which is an extra $300.  For my desktop, this means either dropping $200 on another SSD or going with rotational storage for my music library.  For my phone, this means downsizing my library by an additional 60%, and I have already had to trim a lot of music out.  Or I could buy another phone and spend $200 to get a model with enough storage for me.  (Streaming to the phone is not always an option.  I spend time in areas without reception.)<p>However, since the difference between FLAC and 260 Kbit&#x2F;s AAC is imperceptible to us mere mortals, I can spend my $500-700 on something more interesting than &quot;insanely cheap storage&quot;, and I get to enjoy my music.<p>Yes, let&#x27;s not have people transcode music needlessly.

"&gt; Thunderbolt with two 40Gb&#x2F;sec links isn&#x27;t tiny either<p>It comparatively is. Thunderbolt is basically a PCI-E Gen 3 x4 slot but over a (very) short cable. Commonly more like an x2 link since getting the x4 speeds is difficult. Commonly 2 thunderbolt ports also share a single controller, so it&#x27;s a 40Gb&#x2F;sec <i>combined maximum</i> not per-port (either port can saturate, but you can&#x27;t hit 80Gb&#x2F;s total). It&#x27;s unclear what the M1&#x27;s controller actually is here, if it&#x27;s dedicated lanes per port or just bifurcation.<p>But lets say the M1 is full on 2 TB3 controllers, for a combined 80Gb&#x2F;s over those 2 ports. That&#x27;s still not much. By comparison the 5600x has 24 PCIe Gen 4 lanes on it. That&#x27;s 380 Gb&#x2F;s of bandwidth off of the CPU. These are all things Apple would need to heavily beef up when they make the Apple Silicon variants of the larger class products. You can&#x27;t do a Mac Pro replacement with 80 Gb&#x2F;s of I&#x2F;O.

"That is true, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the sheer glacial speed that Sprint is moving at to improve their network. They have the most spectrum of all of the carriers but do not use it properly. Quarterly announcements of the Spark network upgrades not meeting their own expectations seems to have become common. You may have LTE but it&#x27;s not very useful if you can barely get 1Mb&#x2F;s.<p>T-Mobile on the other hand is having greater success with their CEO and all of the &quot;uncarrier&quot; tactics they are implementing. T-Mobile is now focusing on upgrading the last of their own cell sites to LTE to expand footprint in the rural parts of the country but they still have a ways to go. And that&#x27;s not to say T-Mobile&#x27;s existing LTE network isn&#x27;t great, it&#x27;s fantastic (if you can actually get it).<p>AT&amp;T is out of new deployable spectrum so their LTE network is slowing down in congested areas. They are deploying tens of thousands of small cell sites to make their network more dense to help with this problem. So say a tower has 100 people sharing 20mhz (10x10) of LTE bandwidth at the same time. If there are now three small cell sites placed away from that tower, each additional site has 20mhz of spectrum to use. So there would then be ~25 on that main tower, and ~25 on each additional small cell site.<p>Verizon&#x27;s original 700mhz LTE network is very congested in a lot of areas, but instead of deploying as many small sites as AT&amp;T, they instead bought that very large chunk of AWS spectrum from cable companies and have it deployed to the majority of their cell sites. In major cities this is a full 40mhz chunk of spectrum (20x20) which theoretically can net you up to 150Mb&#x2F;s if you have the right device that can use band 4. They also have started re-farming a small portion of their PCS spectrum (10mhz total) in some testing areas (san francisco especially). They will need to densify their network eventually but they sure have done a great job at buying an ample amount of time.<p>I personally feel Sprint&#x27;s current slump all comes down to the Clearwire&#x2F;WiMax decision. Both Sprint and Verizon were in the same situation when it came to deploy their choices of 4G technologies. They both operated CDMA&#x2F;EVDO 3G networks which with the revision they were using maxed out around 3.1Mb&#x2F;s. AT&amp;T was in the middle of deploying their HSPA&#x2F;HSPA+, what they now call &quot;4G&quot; (not to be confused with LTE). Verizon and Sprint did not have the option of this transition period of significantly higher speeds that was not LTE or WiMax. Surprisingly Verizon got this right. They obtained a nationwide chunk of 700mhz block c (band 13) spectrum for their initial LTE network they started deploying in early 2011. This is the same spectrum that has the open access rules attached to it that made them back down on throttling on their LTE network. The sheer speed at which they deployed this LTE spectrum was just ridiculously fast. Right now they have 99% of their entire 3G footprint covered with that layer of LTE while AT&amp;T&#x27;s national map is still nowhere close to Verizon in terms of overall LTE deployment covering their entire legacy networks.<p>Meanwhile Sprint went ahead with WiMax and we all know how that unfolded. I hope they can recover as 4 national carriers is always going to be better than 3 competition wise, but I just don&#x27;t see it happening for potentially years from now.<p>In terms of network, Verizon got it 100% right the entire time. AT&amp;T struggled in ~2009 with the iPhone and recovered but is feeling the effects of congestion but they are countering with tons of small cell sites. Verizon has congestion on the band 13 LTE deployment, but band 4 is helping with that. T-Mobile&#x27;s LTE deployments are great, but they are still focusing on expanding into more rural areas. Sprint is working on their Spark network, and where you can get it, it&#x27;s good, but they just are moving so damn slow I don&#x27;t know if it will be fast enough in the long run."

The apples-to-apples comparison here is between the two versions of PG where the performance improvement is clear. It&#x27;s harder to do an apples-to-apples comparison between PG and SQL Server because the optimal schema and queries for a particular workload are likely to differ for each of them."
"Like the author in the original article, I used to be all about TDD. Now, I like to tell people that &quot;I&#x27;m apostate in the ways of TDD&quot;. I specifically use the language of religion because I think strict adherence to TDD is itself a religion.<p>I somewhat disagree with the statement he makes, &quot;we know that most developers do not have great design&#x2F;refactoring skills&quot;. I&#x27;ve certainly worked at places that all but ordered me to never refactor code, and I suspect my experience is very far from unique. They thought &quot;refactoring&quot; was a made-up word that programmers used to cover up dicking around and wasting time. From a non-programmer&#x27;s perspective, all they see is the programmer spending several hours with the end result being that nothing has visibly changed. Mind you, no visible changes is the ideal case for refactoring, so you have no easy means to explain why that is wrong.<p>He says that TDD only works if the programmer is good, but I think it&#x27;s more the case that test-first only works in cases where we have very well-defined problems. For these TDD trainers that he&#x27;s talking about, they&#x27;ve gone through the same problem set over and over again. For an experienced programmer, if you&#x27;re encountering the same sorts of problems, you know what the pitfalls are and can look ahead, even if you aren&#x27;t violating YAGNI, you can still do yourself some favors.<p>To put it to a specific metric, if you have a specification from which you&#x27;re working, you basically have an answer sheet for your code. You can then write code that automatically verifies that your code matches that answer sheet. The more like &quot;having a spec&quot; your problem is, the more likely TDD will work very well for you.<p>But I don&#x27;t do that kind of work very frequently. Most of my work is extremely experimental, fluid, and in a lot of ways, its behavior is arbitrary. Does a padding of 5px or 10px look better? Should the surface of a polygon be more or less smooth? Should running over the ground be 3m&#x2F;s or 5m&#x2F;s? Should the user have two hand tools that are identical, or should they be different tools? A lot of it has to be visually verified, because it would otherwise require a computer vision algorithm of some kind to know that the code I wrote to go from text to screen pixels worked correctly.<p>It&#x27;s much more <i>design</i> than <i>development</i>, just that design is expressed in code rather than in Photoshop PSDs.<p>As a result, I focus much more on REPLs, saved REPL sessions, demo code, and making the iteration time between code change and test run as narrow as possible. What I think TDD provides (poorly) for people in this situation is this REPL-like behavior, in languages that don&#x27;t particularly provide a good REPL (let us consider RoR a separate &quot;language&quot; from Ruby, in this case, as the expectations tend to be completely separate).<p>So if I&#x27;m writing an implementation of a rope data structure as part of a syntax highlighting text editor that renders into a WebGL texture, yeah, I have tests for that. Ropes and text editors are well-understood data structures, there&#x27;s lots of information available about them, and there are right and wrong answers to what operations each should have and how they should behave. But that&#x27;s not where the work ends. I still need to figure out how to let people interact with that text editor, be it with touch gestures or motion controllers or a keyboard or a gamepad or what have you, and that has no easy-mode."

"Properly governments operate by the consent of those they govern.<p>Gangs rule territory and the people within it almost strictly by violence. The closest similar in governments is a dictatorship, which must rule by the constant arbitrary application of violence to keep people terrified.

Codes of honor that are strictly adhered to within the mafia or gangs is wholly a fantasy, a lie, cheap hollywood bullshit at odds with all of history. Brutal behavior is a requirement of maintaining power as a gang. Gangs must also constantly murder or intimidate other neighboring gangs, to maintain their territorial control. Properly a government does not behave that way. The US doesn&#x27;t need to kill everyone in Canada and take what they have, in order for the US to be prosperous or to maintain US sovereignty and power; the same goes for the relations between eg Finland and Sweden, or Australia and New Zealand.<p>Gangs very specifically do not primarily operate by an objective application of rules of justice. Stable, prosperous nations &amp; their governments tend to thrive precisely due to the application of objective laws, the steady enforcement of and protection of human liberty. Gangs operate by the subjective command at the top and the effective enslavement of productive people through terror. The rules are subject to arbitrary, often extreme, change when it&#x27;s convenient to the gang&#x27;s ruler&#x2F;s. A new gang leadership can pivot the gang to an entirely different behavior on a whim; such behavioral change is wrong in a civilized nation, where human rights protections should be the primary concern and are not up for arbitrarily being tossed out the window. When the next leadership of the governments of Australia or Sweden come into being, they aren&#x27;t going to randomly decide to murder a lot of people to establish their dominance.<p>This list doesn&#x27;t stop, the differences between a proper government and a gang is elaborate.

This time is not exactly affected by dilation. Anything traveling with you will not have its time go faster or slower. Anything that is <i>not</i> traveling with you, say stationary on Earth, will indeed have its passage of time shifted with respect to you.<p>Coordinate time is the time observed by an observer at the center of the gravity well, looking at you (not always, but generally so for most calculations. Also, observer = origin of frame of reference) and that is what is morphed and bent around.

"I think that your model is correct, but I think that it&#x27;s possible to add a few simplifications.<p>If the speed of sound is ~5m&#x2F;s and the feather length is 0,2m then the time to for a signal to travel from one tip to the other is ~1&#x2F;25s. That is approximately one frame in a standard camera (PAL&#x2F;NTSC). So if they are using a standard camera, it&#x27;s possible to assume that the drop signal travels almost instantly.<p>The system is totally overdamped, so I think that it&#x27;s better to model it as a movement in a fluid with hight viscosity (like a spring inside honey). If you drop the acceleration term and you get<p>2ζω.D[x] + ω²x = 0<p>where 2ζω&#x2F;ρ is something like the apparent viscosity that see a barbule moving inside the &quot;fluid&quot; of the other barbules.<p>The solution is<p>X = A exp(-ω&#x2F;2ζ t)<p>So the relaxation time is ω&#x2F;2ζ. When it&#x27;s overdamped the system almost don&#x27;t oscillates. Watching at the video, after it falls 1-ball-diameter the barbules reach the final position. I guess the ball is ~0,3m, so I guess that ω&#x2F;2ζ ~= Sqrt(2h&#x2F;g) = 0,8 seconds ~= 20 frames in a standard camera. But I have not idea about a sensible value for ζ."

"I would suggest that you go to Facebook. Why? Being an SV company, they will generally treat developers better than say Palantir.

"It depends on whether the propellant is used to increase or decrease the orbital velocity of the vessel.<p>Acceleration propellant would have to be ejected at the orbital velocity of the vessel plus escape velocity to escape.  Deceleration propellant would just have to be ejected at escape velocity minus orbital velocity.<p>As deceleration near atmosphere is almost free just by dipping into it, or by using some form of sea anchor to pull on the atmosphere or magnetic field, it is more likely that propellant would be used preferentially for attitude control and acceleration.<p>It isn&#x27;t impossible, but imparting enough velocity to propellant for it to escape Earth orbit--while accelerating a vessel in the opposite direction--seems unlikely for orbital station-keeping.  You need at least 12000 m&#x2F;s for escape velocity plus at least 8000 m&#x2F;s to counteract the orbit you were already in, so the propellant would have to leave the vessel at more than 20000 m&#x2F;s.  That&#x27;s a specific impulse of about 2000 s.  Ion drives and VASIMR could do it, but the propellant is very likely to experience its own atmospheric drag and electromagnetic interactions, and the probability that any particular atom of propellant would actually escape with the minimum velocity-relative-to-vessel is very low.  The propellant would spread out to a larger volume as quickly as it could, too.  It&#x27;s far more likely that one of those xenon ions would collide with a hydrogen atom in the upper atmosphere and randomly bounce it out, like a bowling ball hitting a billiard ball."

"I don&#x27;t know of any data that isolates the energy cost of transport and storage of cash. Transactions are tricky, you could use the salary of the worker for the 5-15 seconds (or however long the handling&#x2F;counting of cash takes) and equate that to cost of electricity.<p>Given a retail worker might cost a business $.03 per minute, you are looking at 1c per transaction. Now let&#x27;s look at BTC. At 9GW when I looked at it, it was processing ~4.5, lets say 5, transactions per second. A kilo-watt-hour (kWh) of electricity will wholesale for 6c. If we are doing 5tx&#x2F;s, that&#x27;s 18000 in 1 hour. 9GWh to do 18000 transactions<p>(9,000,000,000) &#x2F; (3600 * 5)<p>Gives us, 500 kWh per transaction, at 6c gives us $30 per transaction.<p>You might be able to argue subsequent cash handling might take a few minutes per transaction handles, but even so.<p>So given cash transactions save at least $20 per transaction, cost of transport and storage IMO would be negligable. These costs drop further with something like credit card transactions.<p>The two biggest problems I see with BitCoin and most PoW currencies (and I&#x27;m going to single out BitCoin) are;<p>1. BitCoin has a maximum transaction speed well below what is required for a world (or country&#x2F;more localised) enconomy, 7 Tx&#x2F;s doesn&#x27;t cut it. VISA apparently does well over 1000+.
2. As mining gets harder, and as the network tries to reach the theoretical transaction speed limit, energy usage grows even more out of control.<p>9GW is such a massive amount of electricity at the moment. Even as solar + wind + storage becomes cheaper to build and capacities grow, it&#x27;ll still be a huge amount of electricity and there usage by the BitCoin network will only grow. This is more electricity usage than the state of NSW in Australia _generates_ most of the time. That powers the residential and commercial electrical needs of a 1st world state with 7.5M people.<p>I think the more cheap power that is available to currencies like BTC, they&#x27;ll keep using more and more with diminishing returns."
"I&#x27;ve spent too many hours of my life improving code.

I put things into certification and saw the loading speeds were only like 2.0MB&#x2F;s.  After some investigating, I discovered I was hitting the limit of the system that was serving the data.<p>I would have never thought that, in 2017, there would be systems in place that couldn&#x27;t serve a single file faster than 2.0MB&#x2F;s."

The problem is that you&#x27;re assuming you&#x27;d use an ordinary English sentence for a passphrase, like something you read on Twitter, not (at the very least) random words or letters.<p>Assume you had a word list of the 10000 most common English words, and picked six of them at random. That&#x27;s probably <i>less</i> than the 50 characters you&#x27;re assuming.<p>There are 10000^6 combinations, so 10000^6&#x2F;2 guesses required. Assume you can hash 1000&#x2F;s per core (IMO if your attacker can get that your hash setting are too weak)...<p>So it&#x27;s going to take 10000^6&#x2F;2&#x2F;1000&#x2F;(3*10^7) core years to crack. If you can devote 1200 CPU cores to this project, you have a 50&#x2F;50 shot at cracking the password by the time the universe is twice as old as it is now.<p>And that&#x27;s just by taking the most obvious of steps to generate a better password, which (again) is probably still less than 50 characters."

"I don&#x27;t know anyone who even approaches the theoretical speed of any 802.11 technology. Your neighbors on the same channel reduce your bandwidth, and neighbors on channels which overlap yours raise the noise floor a lot. I have a Moto X Pure and a Ubiquiti Unifi AP AC Lite, and I should theoretically get 867 mbit&#x2F;s. I never even approach that in practice, even if I&#x27;m in the same room. There are more than 30 available networks nearby when I look on my phone. Even if I achieved the theoretical rate, the bandwidth falls off a cliff once you leave the room, as 5ghz signals are significantly attenuated by walls. I can max out my internet (75 mbit) if I&#x27;m in the same room as my AP, but I can&#x27;t stream 1080p content on the 5ghz if I have 2 walls between me and my AP.<p>That being said, the Apple APs are the fastest consumer-grade APs out there. If you are going to hit the theoretical maximum, an Apple AP is your best bet. I don&#x27;t think streaming is where people notice issues with their internet though. In my experience people tend to notice issues in video games, skype, facetime, and other applications where there isn&#x27;t a buffer to hide issues with dropped packets first."

"This is seriously a big deal for the storage industry! Basically what you have created is something in high demand, yet lacking in the storage industry because of its complexity.<p>What I&#x27;ve read so far is that this is a storage solution that seamlessy integrates several storage technologies, including your own. This storage layer will have cross platform clients, using Fuse and Dokany with user sessions per client managed by your Infinit Storage Service. The end-users do not have to learn a new technology&#x2F;user-interface and just get an external hard drive. Very similar to how Bitcasa works, with the exception that you give the power of the actual storage architecture to the system administrators. This mean we can freely choose our own storage cluster, for example Ceph or Infinit&#x27;s own.<p>And as you plan to release this has open source, you allow a lot of new businesses to grow which together will manage to challenge Dropbox, Amazon, Azure and so on.<p>For the last few months I have been working on building a Dokany client that used Ceph Rados-GateWay with Erasure Coding. Where I live we have really fast fiber internet with extremely low latency. Dokany is really performant and can easily manage to read&#x2F;write 30-80MS&#x2F;s between two clients living in Norway and Denmark(same ISP). It&#x27;s a lot of work though, and there are several corner cases that causes issues. However if I scrap mine and start using your technology, I can take advantage of your great work and I can contribute back mine to make it even better. My final point being, with this it should possible to offer high performance &quot;remote drives&quot; to end-users. In some cases maybe even faster than an external hard drive. A partnership with a local ISP could offer them a great incentive to use this technology to sell even faster internet access to their existing customers. The best part, this traffic is inside their own network which means less money has to be paid for internet bandwidth. I know my ISP is desperate for something like this, and I guess a lot of other ISP&#x27;s around the world is highly interested in offering something similar too."

"The current gen hardware is over 6 years old, and when writing for it you can definitely feel its age. Modern PC hardware even at the lower end is so much better and easier to deal with. Also you are forced to make the game run on the lowest specification of any console version, so that means the least powerful machine of all the consoles of this generation.<p>For a low end PC system we are talking about having 8 cores, 16GB of ram, a decent video card, and an SSD usually or at least a disk capable of 100+ MB&#x2F;s. Also the platform is pretty easy to develop for and release on.<p>For a console you get 5 or 6 cores to use, each of which is not as good as a modern CPU core, 8GB of shared ram, and a disk where you have to handle being only able to read from it at 30MB&#x2F;s. You also have to deal with the black box of vendor tools, that don&#x27;t necessarily work easily.<p>So the whole team ends up spending a lot of time actually optimising the game to actually run on these underpowered and lowest spec&#x27;d consoles. Removing extra details, downgrading graphics, culling data, compressing, managing memory, just so it can run at 30fps."

"<i>I disagree - the rampant complexity of systems you can build using all these extra services is the bigger problem,</i><p>So now I am going to manage my own queueing system, object storage system, messaging system, Load Balancer, etc? My time is valuable.<p><i>and at scale, all these extra services on AWS cost more than their OSS equivalent running on VMs. Take a look at ELB for example, there&#x27;s a per-request charge that yes is very small, but at 10k req&#x2F;s it&#x27;s significant - not to mention the extra bytes processed charges. Nginx&#x2F;haproxy with DNS load balancing can do pretty much what ELB is offering. </i><p>ELB automatically scales with load. Do you plan to overprovision to handle peak load? My manager would laugh at me if I were more concerned with saving a few dollars than having the cross availability zone, fault tolerant, AWS managed ELB.<p><i>In the very small none of this matters, but you can just run smaller&#x2F;bigger VMs as needed; prices starting at the cost of a hamburger per month.</i><p>Again, we have processes that don’t have to process that many messages during a lull but can quickly scale up 20x. Do we provision our VMs so they can handle a peak load?<p><i>Re reliablity, I have VMs on AWS with multiple years of uptime - it&#x27;s the base building block of the entire system, so it&#x27;s expected to work all the time. You monitor those systems with any sort of nagios-type tool and alert into something like pager duty for when things do go wrong, but they mostly don&#x27;t.</i><p>Why would I want to be <i>alerted</i> when things go wrong and be awaken in the middle of the night? I wouldn’t even take a job where management was so cheap that they wouldn’t spend money on fault tolerance and scalability and instead expected me to do wake up in the middle of the night.<p>The lambda runtime doesn’t “go down”. Between Route53 health checks, ELB health checks, EC2 health checks, and autoscaling, things would really have to hit the fan for something to go down after a successful deployment.<p>Even if we had a slow resource  leak, health checks would just kill the instance and bring up a new one. The alert I would get is not something I would have to wake up in the middle of the night for, it would be something we could take our time looking at the next day or even detach an instance from the autoscaling group to investigate it.<p><i>Redundancy I build in at the VM layer.
Additional services on AWS however have their own guarantees and SLAs and they&#x27;re more often down than the low-level virtual machines are - so it&#x27;s an inherently less reliable way to build systems imo, but to each their own.</i><p>When have you ever heard that the lambda runtime is down (I’m completely making up that term - ie the thing that runs lambdas).<p><i>Also, this notion that you can conveniently split your processing up into 15m chunks is just crazy -- you may never know how long some batch job is going to take any given day if it&#x27;s long running.</i><p>If one query is taking up more than 15 minutes, it’s probably locking tables  and we need to optimize the ETL process....<p>And you still didn’t answer the other question. How do you handle scaling? What if your workload goes up 10x-100x?<p><i>I met a guy who built some scraper on lambda that did something convoluted and he was happy to make like 100k updates in the db overnight -- I built a similar thing using a single core python job running on a VM that did 40MM updates in the same amount of time. It&#x27;s just silly what people think simple systems are not capable of.</i><p>Then he was doing it wrong. What do you think a lambda is? It’s just a preconfigured VM. There is nothing magic you did by running on Linux EC2 instance that you also couldn’t have optimized running a lambda - which is just a Linux VM with preinstalled components.<p>Yes costs do scale as you grow and they may scale linear but the cost should scale at lower slope than your revenues. But then again, I don’t work for  a low margin B2C company. B2B companies have much greater margins to work with and the cost savings of not having to manage infrastructure is well worth it.<p>If I get called <i>once</i> after I get off work about something going down, it’s automatically my top priority to find the single point of failure and get rid of it.<p>Another example is SFTP. Amazon just announced a managed SFTP server. We all know that we could kludge something together much cheaper than what Amazon is offering. But my manager jumped at the chance to get rid of our home grown solution that we wouldn’t have to manage ourselves."

Instead of spending 100 developer&#x2F;dbadmin hours on reorganizing our tables for some query that runs once a week, we put $2500 of drives and solved more problems than I imagined.<p>The easiest problems are the ones that go away if you throw money at them and NVMe drastically expands the set of such problems. Most small-mid-sized companies have DBs in the 10Gb-1TB range. If you have a single table that&#x27;s 100GB in size, you can parse through every single row in just under a minute!

"That’s all true. The flip side is that there’s also problems that do actually require specialized training. An example that comes to mind for me from a few years ago involved real-time simulation of a constellation of satellites. The accuracy was on the order of meters. I ended up implementing RK4 as a solver, and had to use pretty complex differential equations (2nd order effects matter at that resolution).<p>The project also involved real-time bitstream generation and modulation at 10MS&#x2F;s. That was a mixture of understanding DSP and some clever hacks to get the performance we needed on the hardware we had. Oh, and concurrency without race conditions, because we needed to use every core we had to make it all work.<p>Yes, there’s lots of business problems that can be solved by programming without much computer science. But there’s also a huge pile of problems where it’s not even clear that it’s possible to solve using current tech. I, personally, much prefer the latter, but to each his or her own."

"The container design is heavily inspired from Google&#x27;s Datacenters. This will continue happening and cannot be prevented, even a new license for the Kernel prohibiting a military use won&#x27;t help. Because they can fork an &quot;old kernel&quot; and continue their secret  development on it. It&#x27;s better to know what the government is doing rather than just trusting on a &quot;license&quot;. We&#x27;ve been shown often enough in the past and present that people can&#x27;t blindly trust a Government&#x27;s actions and ethics.<p>Do the containers shield against strong EM fields? Otherwise an enemy could detonate a mini em-&#x2F;atom-bomb close to the target, in order to destroy their operative computer systems. Is that the reason for the heavy metal casing? In that case they probably also used Fiber cables with the lastest known modulation techniques to get (n-)Terabit&#x2F;s per container.

"The distinction between 56k and slower speeds was that 56k could not be transmitted over the digital part of the POTS network in its modem audio format. Telephone systems are generally analogue between the house and the exchange (or road-side cabinet), and then digital between that and the main telephone network. The digital encoding was 8000 samples per second, at eight bits per sample, with a logarithmic transfer function in order to reduce noise levels when the line is quiet. So, the digital part of a telephone line ran at 64kb&#x2F;s.<p>In order to support 56k speeds, the exchange (or road-side box) had to be upgraded. Normal exchanges used a simple 8-bit DAC and ADC, but when a 56k modem was attached it would have to switch to a different mode. Effectively, the remote modem was moved from the ISP to the exchange, with the digital part of the POTS network transmitting de-modem-ed data, rather than a digital representation of an analogue signal encoding digital data, which is what happens with slower speeds.<p>So yes, the 56k signal was transmitted over an analogue line, but no the 56k signal was not transmitted over the main POTS network. Work beyond 56k was not pursued because the underlying digital telephone network could not actually transmit data at a higher rate.<p>This is also where the 64kb&#x2F;s speed of an ADSL line comes from by the way. That just extends the digital part of the POTS network to the house. ADSL allows a slightly higher data rate (64kb&#x2F;s rather than 56kb&#x2F;s) because it has a side channel that carries the control signals such as dialling and flow control, whereas 56k modems had to send flow control and error correction in-band."

"<i>The worst way to store and manipulate text is to use an array. Firstly, the entire file must be loaded into the array first, which raises issues with time and memory. Even worse still, every insertion and deletion requires each element in the array to be moved. There are more downsides, but already this method is clearly not practical. The array can be dismissed as an option rather quickly.</i><p>The authors of the dozens of tiny editors using this &quot;structure&quot;, which were quite popular on the PC in the late 80s through early 90s, would disagree. A memcpy&#x2F;memove() runs at many GB&#x2F;s on a typical machine today, so you would have to be editing absolutely <i>huge</i> files to notice. Even back then, memory bandwidth was a few MB&#x2F;s --- still plenty fast, considering that the typical files of the time were also much smaller.<p>I can remember a time when I was attempting to write my own editor and at first spending a lot of time obsessing over the data structures (it was harder to find such information at the time) --- only to realise that a lot of the editors I&#x27;d tried, including the one I was using the most at the time --- were working perfectly well with just one big buffer.<p>I&#x27;ve opened files of a few hundred MB in Windows&#x27; Notepad, which also belongs to this family of editors; and on a machine a few years old, opening the file takes the longest because it has to be read into memory --- once it&#x27;s opened, moving around and editing lines doesn&#x27;t show much lag at all. &quot;Worse is better&quot;, indeed."
"Yes, it does.  SD cards are not really designed for being used as a root file system.  They are OK at streaming writes and reads, but once you start getting non sequential they slow down like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  Which, yes, I know, is super weird for what should just be some glue logic around a NAND.<p>I was investigating corruption and performance problems with our root filesystem on an SD card.  The cards would be great a obvious benchmark style tasks, but when I recorded the block access pattern from our driver and replayed that on a Linux desktop with O_DIRECT, we&#x27;d not only get under 200KiB&#x2F;s average access speed (which matched what we were seeing on the embedded system), but we would also get corrupted sectors (ie. we write it just fine, but we just get an error back from the card when we go to read the sector) in less than a day of sustained writes (once again at only 200KiB&#x2F;s).  And this was with high quality SanDisk cards that were then verified by them to be real cards (for a while we thought that clones had made their way into our supply chain).  Using a weird form factor eMMC chip in an SD card got rid of these issues.   There&#x27;s also &quot;industrial&quot; SD cards that are around the same price that I suspect are basically the same thing."

"I&#x27;ve read this half a dozen times over the last days, trying to understand exactly what you are getting at.  I think what you are saying is that you could use the power generated by the wheel to power the thruster, which would in turn spin the wheel.<p>The part I don&#x27;t understand is why you think this &quot;Wheel Generator&quot; would impart any significant thrust to the wheel.<p>That is, let&#x27;s say (for the sake of argument), that you needed 1 watt to generate 1 newton of thrust.  And, that one newton of thrust could get a wheel spinning at 10 m&#x2F;s.  Now, we hook that wheel up to a generator, and it&#x27;s capable of generating 1&#x2F;10th of a watt of energy, but in doing so, obviously comes to a halt without external energy being imparted (because obviously the generator uses up its momentum to generate energy) - but, the energy being created by the spinning wheel (1&#x2F;10th of a watt), only can get the wheel spinning at 1 m&#x2F;s.<p>The entire system comes to a halt quickly.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that the entire idea of a reactionless thruster doesn&#x27;t have huge holes in it - but it certainly doesn&#x27;t seem to (at least) suggest that you have a perpetual motion machine."

"&gt; or create a byte-array of some sort that gets translated, which while faster, still isn&#x27;t fast enough.<p>Except, of course, about 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the best SVGA era cards were.<p>I mean, you got many GB&#x2F;s bandwidth now. Yes, that Tseng Labs ET4000 was amazing, with 7 MB&#x2F;s over ISA, beating most (all?) other cards I bothered to try back then.<p>Or some basic (but fast) later PCI card like S3 Trio 64+ 50 MB&#x2F;s (IIRC).<p>PCIe 3.0 can do up to 16 GB&#x2F;s over 16 lanes. Even if it were 7 GB&#x2F;s in practice, we&#x27;re still talking about 1000x improvement compared to the best ISA SVGA card.

"The speed would be much better than an SD card, but nowhere near the peak M.2 performance we&#x27;ve come to love. The SoC they use only has a single lane of PCIe Gen 2.

"More accurately, you need 7.9 km&#x2F;s to get into orbit. You can fly into space at a far lower speed of about 1.2 km&#x2F;s; you just will fall back.

So this aircraft would need two orders of magnitude better heat protection than the Space Shuttle. Not to mention the aerodynamic drag at these altitudes and velocities, which will be tremendous."
"I usually don&#x27;t comment on these threads but felt the need to jump in. While I totally understand and agree that ANY business needs to turn a profit in order to stay in the market. I fundamentally disagree with the distribution of work vs risk in proportion to profit in a traditional consultancy model.<p>The assumption that seems to be present throughout this thread is that there is an owner&#x2F;s (not necessarily the same person as the operator) present who needs to take a percentage from the bill rate. This model is inherently extractive and sets up a really bad set of incentives for the people doing the productive work. (productive in this case is actually writing code&#x2F;solving client problems and maybe not doing the marketing, administrative, or sales work of the business.)<p>I know someone is going to raise the point that there has to be an owner to put up the capital&#x2F;bear the initial risk of starting up, which is totally valid! This will always be true I just think that there should be a route&#x2F;way for the productive worker to work towards a piece of that ownership pie.<p>Also, the fact that the bill rate vs pay rate is transparent is actually great.

"USB-C isn&#x27;t a utopia in terms of fixing the USB complexity. 
All it truly solved was the connector problem which by itself is HUGE in retrospect and not something I appreciated.<p>If you thought the transition from ATA -&gt; SATA or PCI, PCI + AGP, PCI-E path was bad, imagine trying to move an industry like USB that has USB1.0, USB2.0, USB3.0, USB3.1 and deals with peripheral components that change at an even slower cadence than internal ones (computers are something like 3-5 years, peripherals are like 3-10). By comparison mobile has had a life span of ~1-3 years (slowing down I think as there&#x27;s plenty of 3-5 year users now &amp; their numbers grow every year). The 1-3 cycle only happens for as long as you have a growing user-base &amp; the churn is required for rapid change to be possible (the market economics support it).<p>When I think about the market dynamics, USB-C is a critical backbone you had to land first (which I didn&#x27;t see when it was first being pushed on us in the consumer electronics industry). USB4 is going to clean some of it up. Without it we were never going to get away from the mess we were in. That being said, USB-C is still a big too big. That&#x27;s why Apple hasn&#x27;t moved. The question will be if the next push will be for contactless data transfer or a smaller connector. It&#x27;ll depend on whether mobile needs the space (&amp; again - even mobile is losing its power to power such a transition) &amp; whether major consumer electronics will identify new small form-factor markets that require a smaller connector. If the Apple Watch&#x2F;AirPods is any model for how these will work, then no. So we&#x27;ll get USB5 &amp; USB6, but it&#x27;ll be &quot;boring&quot; transitions like it is with Ethernet RJ45 cables (Cat 4, Cat 5, Cat 6, Cat 6e, Cat7) etc. Some of the customer complexity will be trickier to navigate if the labelling piece isn&#x27;t addressed for cables &amp; ports (otherwise you get an alphabet soup of standard names supported by a given cable&#x2F;port &amp; what the peripheral requires). These are hopefully more manageable problems though (although more tricky than Ethernet). One could imagine where you have different classes to describe power the cable &amp; port can run, a different class of the functionality supported (power only, peripherals, peripherals + displays). Peripheral speeds here would be &gt; than ethernet so we&#x27;re also potentially going to see USB-C consume the space of ethernet ports. This happened in laptops but it&#x27;ll be trickier in PC form factors. Everything you&#x27;d plug into is RJ45 anyway &amp; ethernet is significantly cheaper on a $&#x2F;ft basis since it&#x27;s cheaper. Maybe it&#x27;ll intercept when consumer ethernet starts to be 10gigabit&#x2F;s or 100gigabit&#x2F;s (if USB4&#x2F;5&#x2F;6&#x2F; supports the speed &amp; lengths needed &amp; the cost is comparable, they&#x27;d probably just layer it over that). I remember working with 1gigabit and 10gigabit&#x2F;s in 2009 at QCOM when the Cat6 standard for Gigabit had just come out &amp; gigabit has only became prevalent in the past few years. You naturally want to consolidate these things as a business to simplify your costs if your sell-through is into a market with very long cycles. Any market that has more iteration. Wireless comms will be that a for a bit until BT &amp; WiFi eat everything they haven&#x27;t already (&amp; potentially WiFi will eat BT eventually). Proprietary cheap connectors&#x2F;wireless in the ultra low-cost niches will be the longest holdouts but even then they&#x27;ll struggle as the customer demand will probably prefer the standard name it sees everywhere else."

But if you even get an SSD in a USB stick like Sandisk Extreme 64GB with reasonable IOPS, you can install OS X&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;Windows there and it would give you that snappy feel. Bandwidth beyond certain threshold is not what is giving you the snappiness. If you take NVMe that reaches 3000MB&#x2F;s comparing to SATA3 with 550MB&#x2F;s, booting time reduces by like 1s - would you really want to pay 2x price when that is the only benefit you&#x27;d notice? Or starting your app would take 0.63s instead of 0.67s?<p>Seriously, invest into NVMe if you are video producer (I can&#x27;t imagine processing my 4K movies on SATA SSD or HDD, even 24fps playback on SATA SSD can&#x27;t happen in RAW format as it needs &gt;1MB&#x2F;s) or you do some heavy I&#x2F;O server stuff. If you don&#x27;t do any of the above, invest your $ into capacity instead, i.e. given 512GB NVMe vs 1TB M.2 SATA I&#x27;d go with 1TB one."

"I just took a couple of these for a quick spin so that I could have an answer if anybody asks about them tomorrow (I&#x27;m doing a LISA&#x27;13 talk about cloud storage performance).  They really are pretty zippy.  Basically they seem about 3x as fast as their predecessors, particularly with respect to disk I&#x2F;O.  The 1GB type is among the fastest in that category at over 15K (synchronous random 4KB) IOPS, for only 50% more per month than competitors.  The 15GB type got over 28K IOPS, which is among the best I&#x27;ve seen in a public cloud (e.g. Storm on Demand 12GB or the astronomically priced AWS hi1.4xlarge).<p>Network-wise, I got the usual Rackspace throttling-induced asymmetry - 194Mb&#x2F;s going from the 1GB instance to the 15GB, 874Mb&#x2F;s the other way.  Likewise, the cloud block storage significantly underperformed the instance storage at just under 8K IOPS - though that&#x27;s still really nothing to sneeze at in a public cloud.<p>For something you can rent by the hour these are pretty sweet.  It&#x27;s not too hard to find 10KIOPS-capable machines elsewhere for much less, but then again those IOPS might not do you much good if the machines are network-constrained (and many of the cheaper providers do tend to be).  As always, measure for yourself.  It&#x27;s always good to see that bar being raised."

"&gt; If both browsers report wildly different base numbers but similar ratios then there is no cheating for micro-benchmarking numbers.<p>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with JS benchmarking, but for the JVM microbenchmarking is genuinely difficult and relatively worthless because the JIT is really good at killing off huge swaths of code if the results aren&#x27;t used and side effects aren&#x27;t observed. And even if you do, it&#x27;s not unusual for it to optimize your code for the microbenchmark in a way that&#x27;s not directly applicable to production use.<p>Unless the benchmarking code around this does some transformations on the source, I would expect a JIT (or an optimizing interpreter) to simply remove a side-effect-free statement. I would certainly expect a state-of-the-art JIT that&#x27;s heavily bound to the DOM implementation to infer &quot;document.getElementById(&quot;#foo&quot;);&quot; is a NOP.<p>&gt; This can be easily debunked using a combination of DOM instructions and taking note of how dramatically the ops&#x2F;s count drops and then comparing that difference in ops&#x2F;s against the same difference from another browser like Chrome.<p>To get back to your particular example, since getElementById in your microbench runs at approximately 100+ times the speed of querySelector (~15 mio op&#x2F;s, which seems like what you&#x27;d expect) I would suspect that querySelector() is not optimized out, because it can actually throw an exception depending on the input."

TCP is fine if you can tolerate 3-5 round trip times&#x27; worth of latency. RTT to the other side of the world is ~135 milliseconds at the speed of light.

Cryptographic keys are generated by HSM in the form of multiple components onto multiple smartcards. Each smartcard is stored in a separate safe where only the security officer&#x2F;s assigned to that component have access. The HSM to be injected with keys must be operated by multiple security officers with their components. The HSM is regularly inspected -- each security officer brings his key from his safe, two keys are required to open the enclosure where the HSM is located.

Each added m&#x2F;s costs more in energy.<p>A reactionless drive working in a system with no preferred frame would add the same amount of acceleration for the same amount of cost, regardless of how much energy there already is. This would mean that eventually it would be going fast enough that the added kinetic energy would be more than however much energy it draws in. Then you can build a gigantic carousel that is spinned on the rim and takes energy from the middle and feeds some back in to move it, and now you have perpetual motion.<p>This is why no real physicist actually thinks that this will be reactionless thrust. However, that does not necessarily mean it&#x27;s useless. If it, for example, allows you to push against the earth&#x27;s magnetic field more weight-efficiently than current magnetic propulsion systems, it would be a major win for satellite stationkeeping."
"Crumple zones decrease the acceleration of your body, but don&#x27;t do anything to the acceleration af objects placed on the rear shelf of your car, assuming negligible friction on the rear shelf of your car.  Plenty of people get injured in accidents by kleenex boxes placed on that rear deck of their car.<p>You&#x27;re travelling at 50 kpm (let&#x27;s call it 14 m&#x2F;s).  You strike a brick wall.  The cell phone on the rear deck of your car flies off the rear deck with minimally deceleration before it leaves the rear deck, travelling 14 m&#x2F;s through mid-air.  Let&#x27;s make a linearizing approximation and say your body is stopped in 0.8m with constant acceleration.  Let&#x27;s assume the phone started out 1.5m behind your head.  By the time your head is stopped by the crumple zone, the phone has travelled 1.6 m, meaning the phone is still 0.7 m behind your head, still travelling 14 m&#x2F;s (50 kph).<p>Granted, there are a bunch of simplifying assumptions here (linear deceleration via crumpling, frictionless rear shelf, zero air resistance), but it shows there are plenty of realistic scenarios where something placed on the rear shelf of your car strikes you in the head only minimally slower than the speed at which you were driving."

"Ultimately, the idea is to mock the database itself so we just return whatever the real database returned during the recording. We don&#x27;t have to run create commands because we aren&#x27;t actually managing a real database&#x27;s internal state.

During the alpha we are limiting support to HTTP&#x2F;s but protocols like MongoDB, redis, MySQL, etc are on the backlog.

"These numbers are great, but they are also highly dependant on hardware architecture and a strong coupling with network architecture.  Another big contributor to messaging is in the message size.  One can claim 10M messages&#x2F;sec but for 1 byte messages, 10m messages&#x2F;s is hardly impressive.<p>I can say that on today&#x27;s hardware, achieving 3-7M msgs&#x2F;sec in a single-stream, guaranteed, in-order messaging is possible.  This us also with 120 byte messages, which amounts to about 3-7Gbps if sustained messaging in clusters of 2 to 200+ machines. What do you need to achieve this?<p>* Kernel bypass network architecture e.g. Solarflare 10&#x2F;40gbe<p>* 10gbe switches<p>* decoupling of transport layer into a dedicated processor cores<p>* busy-polling processes<p>* business logic placed on dedicated cores.<p>* use of shared memory and&#x2F;or memory mapping to transport messaging between processes.<p>It all sounds fairly convoluted to throw up processes and burn a core on rx&#x2F;tx, but if you need to process millions of messages a second at fairly low latency, this is about the limit of where it goes.  Using traditional application and socket tied to a single process will get you to around 1 million messages&#x2F;sec with some very large buffers and efficient business logic, but thst eill be about it.

"Yeah, high precision timers aren&#x27;t a fix-all. Imagine a loop where you test a single bit of some protected memory. If it takes microseconds to determine the value of that bit that&#x27;s really bad, but even if it takes milliseconds, seconds, or even <i>hours</i> that&#x27;s still <i>really bad</i>. This is equivalent to how fast an attacker can download your system&#x27;s memory during an attack. If that rate is mb&#x2F;s that&#x27;s catastrophic, if it&#x27;s kb&#x2F;s that&#x27;s still super bad, if it&#x27;s bits per day that might be enough to mean that only the highest value systems will be targeted, but that&#x27;s a far cry from actual security."

"&gt; Maybe someone can educate me. I&#x27;ve studied them for a while, but I don&#x27;t get the fascination with lock- or wait-free queues.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re running a multi-threaded program.  The threads (at some point) need to talk to each other.  Perhaps to exchange data.<p>The simplest solution is to use a mutex.  It&#x27;s simple.  Just take your existing single-threaded queue &#x2F; list &#x2F; tree code, and slap a mutex around it.  Maybe 10 lines of code changed.  It will work.<p>Then you do profiling... you discover that when 30 threads exchanged 10&#x27;s of 1000&#x27;s of messages per second, mutex contention is a <i>huge</i> problem.  You can easily have 30% of wall-clock time spent waiting for contented mutexes.<p>When you move to lock-free algorithms, you give up a little, and gain a lot.  If you&#x27;re willing to relax some requirements, even better.  e.g. I care that the other thread gets a message... but it doesn&#x27;t have to be <i>now</i>.  It could be a millisecond in the future.<p>A lock-free queue means that you can just dump messages to another thread, and they&#x27;ll show up in the other thread.  (Eventually, when it gets around to looking at the queue).<p>And mutex contention does <i>way</i> down.  Especially because you&#x27;re no longer using mutexes!<p>There can still be some contention on CAS in lock-free algorithms, especially for MPMC queues.  The solution there (as is done in the linked project) is to move to single-producer single-consumer queues as much as possible.<p>The contention goes down to pretty much zero, and performance goes up.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a good chunk of the last few months re-designing the core of FreeRADIUS to avoid mutexes, shared memory, etc.  The old code would get ~40K packets&#x2F;s with multiple highly contended mutexes.  The new test code is getting 3-4M packets&#x2F;s with a lock-free queue &#x2F; message passing system.<p>i.e. mutexes were killing performance in the old system.  They&#x27;re gone in the new system.  And performance is substantially higher."

"&gt; like everyone else does<p>Nobody else does this. I have absolutely no idea what you could possibly be referring to. SpaceX lands on land preferably when it is an option.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t understand why they won&#x27;t keep landing them on the ground ... It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s not enough space on Earth<p>As a general rule, you not understanding the reason for something does not mean there is not a good reason. For reference, see the Dunning-Kruger effect. Furthermore, I honestly do not understand how you could even contemplate &quot;SpaceX does not think there is enough space on land&quot; as a serious argument and treat its dismissal as legitimate support for your beliefs. This is some of the most egregiously lazy reasoning I have ever seen on the internet.<p>SpaceX launches rockets in the direction of water so that an accident won&#x27;t threaten property or people on land. To return to land after staging the first stage of the Falcon 9 must perform a burn—the &quot;boost back&quot;—to point its lateral velocity back to land; this is the first of three burns required for landing and the most expensive in fuel by a considerable margin. If the first stage is travelling too quickly (greater than approximately 1.6 km&#x2F;s lateral velocity) it does not physically have enough fuel to return to the launch site and perform the landing. In this case, a far more mild burn can put the booster on a re-entry trajectory and it can land on an autonomous barge in the ocean. As the rocket trajectory is chosen to put the ground path well away from land, the choice is between either returning to the launch site or landing in the ocean. If a return to the launch site is prohibited by the rocket&#x27;s capabilites and physics then an ocean landing is the only option.<p>In the case of Jason-3 a barge landing was the only option as SpaceX does not yet have permission to use their landing facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In the future, the central core of the Falcon Heavy will almost certainly have to land in the ocean due to its velocity at separation."

"Humans are comfortable with accelerations of maybe 1 m&#x2F;s&#x2F;s.

You&#x27;ve got no way to abort and go around, and no time to do... well, anything, really.<p>Parachutes for vehicles the size of a passenger aeroplane are not practical.

"I disagree with the other comment; the COL calculators must NOT be taken as face value. Just like you pointed out the rent and state taxes are perhaps the biggest increase in expense.

"In Norway if one has a copper phone line into house, then the speed is typically bound by 40 Mbit&#x2F;s. And it is not just rural areas. The apartment I live in is close to the center of Oslo.

"The calculation is straight forward.  The coefficient given for rolling resistance is 0.0004 for rail which means that .0004W is the frictional resistance of the track.  Given a train going at velocity v then the train is accelerated by friction at a rate of -.0004W&#x2F;m (F=ma so a=F&#x2F;m) which is equal to -.0004g (W=mg).<p>Then to stop it will take t = v&#x2F;.0004g which means that you will travel vt&#x2F;2 in that time.<p>For example, if a train is cruising along at 30 mph (44 fps) then it takes 44 ft&#x2F;s &#x2F; .0004(32.2 ft&#x2F;s^2) = 3416 seconds to stop which means that the train travels 14.2 miles under ideal conditions."

"Thanks! I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. As for the VPN part yeah you&#x27;ll definitely want a VPN if you use torrents for the download source.<p>For my setup I have Radarr&#x2F;Sonarr set to prefer Usenet and only resort to the torrent if it can&#x27;t find a release after 24 hours. Just because Usenet eliminates the problem of having a single seeder uploading at 1kb&#x2F;s and things like that. I would highly recommend grabbing a Usenet subscription if you&#x27;re setting this system up. In SabNZBD you can setup which provider you prefer and then it goes down the list. My #1 is Newshosting.com, then Eweka.nl (they follow a different DMCA process so chance of a completed download is higher if a chunk is missing from Newshosting. SAB will use all sources to find missing pieces of the file automatically), then a 50GB block at Tweaknews, and finally a free trial block account at Usenet.farm. I am rambling at this point, if you want more info on this part feel free to ask.<p>As for your actual question - I have everything in Docker containers running on OpenMediaVault on a server in my house. I use the &#x27;docker-transmission-openvpn&#x27; container as a self contained unit, it handles setting up the VPN connection for that container only so that the whole server isn&#x27;t behind a VPN. For a provider I&#x27;ve had great luck with PIA for the last couple years, they don&#x27;t care about torrenting. For Usenet downloads no VPN is needed.<p>I hand rolled this setup with a bunch of pre-made docker containers and configuring them myself. Someone else I know has a similar setup based on &#x27;Cloudbox&#x27; (on Github) and that seems to be working well for him too."

"Kudos for having an electrical safety page. But is not complete. Some of these installations appear to be both fire and shock hazards.
1. even for flame-rated PC and ABS, the RTI is typically under 50C, so any long-term exposure to LED heat is a fire hazard.
2. unless the power supply is Class II construction, the indicated wiring does not provide a reliable ground bond. GFI will not always help, as it depends on which version of the NEC for the building wiring. Best to choose a p&#x2F;s certified IAW UL8750 (will bear the mark of an NRTL and a reference number) that is rated for Class II ops (will have the double insulation logo). If Class I construction required, never use wire nuts for ground lead connections - use terminals and double-crimped connectors.
3. The power supply should be rated for end-use; that is, is should not be a &#x27;component power supply&#x27;. UL refers to end-use stuff as &#x27;Listed&#x27;, and components as &#x27;recognized&#x27;. There are other terms for other materials and eauipment, and the terms vary depending on the NRTL that issued the certification (CSA, TUVR, MET, UL, etc).
4. wiring &#x27;styles&#x27; (UL has a exhaustive database for this stuff) should be rated for the temperatures the insulation is exposed to, and be rated for the voltage and current that would be present during a fault condition.

"No, but while learning to fly I&#x27;d describe it more as terrifying.

"To broadly cover most of what you brought up, we think our &quot;secret sauce&quot; that both will allow us to actual make a commercially viable processor and allow us to compete is the fact that we are developing some very advanced software in house taking advantage of many new techniques. I can&#x27;t go into  too many details, but we actually think we have developed what is close to the long talked about and &quot;magic&quot; compiler.<p>When it comes to something like the X1 you have to remember NVIDIA loves exaggerating their benchmark results. In reality, it gets around 80% of its theoretical peak, but if you apply it to double precision, it only gets around 40 GFLOPs on Linpack (out of a theoretical 64 DP GFLOPs). Even if you take NVIDIA at face value and say they get full theoretical peak (64 GFLOPs double precision) at 10 watts, that only gets you 6.4 GFLOPs&#x2F;Watt. One thing that has been completely disregarded in this and my previous posts has been that the GFLOPs numbers we have been saying have been for Linpack and matrix-matrix (Level 3 BLAS) workloads, which are a very small number of real world applications... I would say on average Level 3 BLAS benchmarks get around 90% of theoretical peak on GPU systems, but as soon as you get into other application spaces (Level 1 and Level 2 BLAS, or anything dealing with a lot of memory movement) is where GPUs really start to fall, and only get ~10-20% of theoretical peak. Our architecture is built to actually be able to reach theoretical peak in a &quot;perfect&quot; (which in our case, our hand written FFT kernel), in all 3 BLAS levels. In reality, I would expect us to hit at least 85-90% theoretical peak in all of those floating point domains.<p>As for Altera and FPGAs... they are a royal PITA to program for, and will never be all that efficient. Altera&#x27;s 10 TFLOP&#x2F;s number is ONLY capable of single precision float, and is based on adding up the theoretical capabilities of all the DSP slices... in reality, you would never be able to hit that with the memory limitations going to all the DSP slices. In small print, Altera even admits their 10 TFLOPs number is BS, as they list the highest FP32 number as 9.2 TFLOPs. Again, that theoretical 80 TFLOPs&#x2F;Watt (which I would be surprised if it hits 50 in the real world) is only for single precision, in which we are aiming for 128. All the while we are a hell of a lot easier to program for.<p>As for short term competition, we know for a fact that Intel and NVIDIA will not be hitting our efficiency levels in this decade, and in addition we will have a cost advantage. Compared to FPGAs, we have the ability to actually port existing code over without huge performance sacrifices (C to gates or Altera&#x27;s OpenCL work is abysmal to performance) or change your development team&#x2F;learn how to write RTL (You can write code for our chip in any language that LLVM has a frontend for).<p>As for market, our initial target market we are actively working on is large constellation FFT type workloads... think LTE-advanced and &quot;5G&quot; basestation processing as that&#x27;s where we have our best numbers (25x efficiency over the best DSPs in that space). Beyond that we are looking at the larger &quot;HPC&quot; category, and in the 5+ years out, I hope to be able to expand to more general purpose markets."

"I would wager that Java&#x27;s GC is better just for the simple fact that it has a whole bunch of knobs you can turn based on your workload.

The solution was to turn the GOGC to 37- this yielded the best results but only increased performance 5%.<p>My coworkers were saying how they had 100s of knobs they could turn and try to try and tune the GC to either reduce the number of pauses, or do one big one every 10 seconds. . Java&#x27;s options are more then I wish to list here. Go has `GOGC=` and that&#x27;s it.<p>As one to one performance, that would be hard to measure, but my guess is Java would win in the end."

"That&#x27;s not a &quot;small carveout&quot;.  That&#x27;s a muzzle.  It&#x27;s asymmetric power, that you&#x27;re only allowed to consume, not to publish.<p>What&#x27;s more, from a technical standpoint, it&#x27;s different for a fiber provider than for a cable company.  Coax cable capacity is asymmetric. It can carry only a given amount of data and they can carve it up to give you more down and less up, equal amounts, or more up and less down.  Obviously most users want fast downloads and aren&#x27;t as concerned about uploads.<p>By contrast, fiber is symmetric, offering full capacities up and down at once.  So while cable has a technical justification for &quot;service levels&quot; to offer a server, fiber providers do not. Google Fiber is 1000&#x2F;1000 Mbit&#x2F;s symmetrical.  Forcing the consumer to not use the idle uplink is against consumer generated content and consumer ownership of their own content, for the sake of a &quot;differentiated business plan&quot;.  It&#x27;s against the democratization of consumer created content that consumers can control themselves.<p>(Google has dogs in that hunt too, you &quot;should&quot; host your content on G+ or YouTube, and host your email on Gmail, rather than drop in a Mac Mini Server or &quot;host any type of server&quot; at home.)<p>FWIW, my $50&#x2F;mo residential plan doesn&#x27;t ban servers, even though the company offers business plans from $200&#x2F;mo up.  I can host a mail server and a web server, with dynamic DNS and open ports 25 and 80.  Ports &gt;1024 are open for all classes of service, even their lowest.<p>Finally, I think the point here is that other consumer broadband providers weren&#x27;t lobbying for network neutrality.

Google was.<p>It feels a bit icky when &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; turns out to mean &quot;<i>for now</i> ... until we have an offering in that area that enough people adopt and this practice we used to actively call evil turns out could make us more money and is actually good ... <i>for us</i>&quot;.<p>Mind you, being magnanimous until they own enough customers is an excellent strategy.

"Incidentally I was reading an old HN post today on Kdb+ for timeseries where people who use that commercial db said it&#x27;s amazingly fast (I only played around with it, nothing speedy). People in that discussion mentioned that 300k writes&#x2F;s  mentioned about Kdb+ is nothing compared to the millions of writes&#x2F;s IoT solutions need. So I am wondering what kind of performance you can get on time series databases on a single machine; I understand that with clustering systems like Cassandra can do 100 million&#x2F;s and more (someone mentioned billions but not what DB), but getting benchmarks just throwing hardware at the problem, to me, only makes sense if we know the performance on a single node, multicore performance single node and then the scaling graph when adding nodes.<p>I am just interested in this kind of thing; I used to work with time series for a German telco; that was DB2 on heavy IBM metal for massive amounts of money and financial work for a startup.

I have this nasty feeling that for the scale mentioned the whole logic can be safely run on a single high performance server with the decent database.

"<i>Meanwhile, I&#x27;d bet 95% of people would be perfectly happy with 5 mbps service, while a small minority wants gigabit.</i><p>Historic and present demand are <i>terrible</i> ways of predicting future demand when it comes to technology.  Most people don&#x27;t know what they want because they&#x27;re living in yesterday, but wait five years when they see what their early adopter neighbors are doing, then suddenly everybody would be happy with gigabit service, and who needs to upgrade to 10GbE anyway?<p>You could easily have said that nobody would want more than 128kb&#x2F;s ISDN, because nobody does anything more intensive than download music, check e-mail, and watch flash animations.  Faster speeds made newer services, services that are used by very ordinary people (like Netflix, Hangouts, Skype) possible."
"10GBASE-T over Cat 5e works pretty well up to 100 ft and 150 ft is doable if you carefully run avoiding electronic noise sources (like a wall power outlet).<p>NBASE-T IMO is much more interesting for end users because by now USB adapters for those should be out and I fully expect them any week to drop. 5gbit&#x2F;s runs up to 300 ft on Cat 5E. Also, while five gigabit is certainly doable for laptops with NVMe disks (last three years, since Skylake), ten gigabit is not necessarily so if you have PCIe 3.0 x2 (or equivalent) bottlenecks here and there. See, many Intel U chip laptops run the on chip bus between PCH and CPU at only a PCIe 3.0 x2 equivalent speed (aka 16 gbit&#x2F;s) and the U chips provide PCIe lanes only off the PCH so if your data streams needs to cross into the CPU and if you are burning 10 out of the 16 for just Ethernet, not a lot will be left. And most of the time you need to cross the On Package Interconnect because the system memory hangs off the CPU side of it and all the peripherals the PCH side of it (northbridge vs southbridge, to use older terms). There&#x27;s no such problem with 5gbit&#x2F;s, you can even put twice of that on a 2GT&#x2F;s OPI and still have bandwidth to spare.<p>Another potential such bandwidth choking point is the Thunderbolt controller, althought that might be past by now, because there is no JHL 7240 or Titan Ridge LP -- there was an Alpine Ridge LP which only used a PCI 3.0 x2 connection to the host meaning if you wanted to have a 5gbit&#x2F;s USB A connection on your dock and you wanted 10 gbit&#x2F;s Ethernet, you are already hitting all the constraints. Once again, 5gbit&#x2F;s eases this problem.<p>In about five years when PCIe 4.0 and USB 3.2 are ubiquitous, well established features in laptops,  that&#x27;s when we can begin to discuss whether ten gigabit makes sense at home&#x2F;small office."

"There is zero chance that Intel can add &quot;good enough&quot; functionality to their CPUs without changing their memory architecture. A high end i7 might have 35 GB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth.

They required a $90 per month ARPU - when you factor in business use (many who would be paying in the region of $400 - $2000 because of higher traffic classes, lower contended CVC, business SLAs, etc), home users would only need to average about $60-70 a month (that&#x27;s more than I pay for ADSL that doesn&#x27;t hit 4Mb&#x2F;s), and that&#x27;s an average which is skewed by the power users (as per the Pareto principle).<p>So the average household would only be paying $30 to $60 a month, which is more than competitive with ADSL when you factor in Telstra line rental. And this is across all services, not necessarily just internet, so add in phone and pay TV, which people already pay $100pm for, and it&#x27;s easily conceivable that prices would have dropped.<p>Even now, if I were in an NBN area I could have 100Mb&#x2F;s internet and VoIP for just $10 more than I pay for my slow ADSL2+ with phone (I&#x27;m on the $79p&#x2F;m iiNet bundle)"

In computer systems you can have a latency of X and a throughput of Y, Z, or any number with no particular relation to X.  Consider for example if I have a system with a throughput of 1000&#x2F;s and a latency of 1ms, which satisfies the given relation but for no particular reason.  Now suppose I add at the beginning of every request a 1-hour delay.  Now my latency is 3600001ms, but my throughput is still 1000&#x2F;s.  The only thing that has changed is the number of requests in flight."

If it&#x27;s complete misinformation, cherry-picked facts twisted to match bad-faith conclusions, and it&#x27;s only going to hurt trans people... Then yes, I&#x27;m going to stand up brave and say &quot;The publisher should refuse to carry this book, because it is full of harmful lies.&quot; Because it is damned expensive to get people to read the truth once they&#x27;ve bought the lies. As a capitalist, I don&#x27;t want to sell the book about why Nazis are good if it means I have to waste a bunch of money writing a book that refutes it, which many of the readers will not read.<p>Of course, now we&#x27;ve invoked the Streisand Effect. It&#x27;s far too late for effective good-faith censorship. Censorship at this point means that I, an adult trans woman with no children, am part of the same `#trans` hashtag as the performative-woke cancel-mob that just wants to mutilate children. I wish I could leave that hashtag. But nobody can take hashtags off once someone puts them on you.<p>If the book is bad, then it&#x27;s too late to censor it. But I wish it had been censored sooner, within the publisher, because I think it&#x27;s a very bad look for a publisher to (following your analogy) publish Nazi propaganda that they could choose to just not publish. If a book comes out to rebut this one, will it make the same headlines? Will it hit the front page of HN? Is this the replication crisis, but for the Twitter age? And before that book gets published, how much damage is done by people accepting un-rebutted misinformation?<p>If the book is good... If it&#x27;s mostly true, if it&#x27;s good-faith concern, and not whataboutism and concern _trolling_, then it still really sucks that people are going to read this headline, maybe even read the book, and come off thinking that I, an adult trans woman with no children, am now part of the same hashtag as the performative-woke cancel-mob that just wants to mutilate children. I wish I could leave that hashtag. But nobody can take hashtags off once someone puts them on you.<p>What&#x27;s my unpopular opinion? People lack nuance. Especially online.<p>In my opinion the book is dangerous because the median person will spend at most 1 minute per day thinking about trans people. If that whole minute is, &quot;Wow, trans people want children to mutilate themselves and separate them from their parents,&quot; then I have lost something.<p>Because now I am vaguely associated with something that we can all agree is terrible. Even if we don&#x27;t agree whether it&#x27;s related to me, or how often it happens. I am sure it has happened at least once, I&#x27;ll grant you that.<p>My unpopular opinion is that I _shouldn&#x27;t_ care about this book. I _shouldn&#x27;t_ feel threatened by free speech. The fact that I come here and write long wordy whiney liberal diatribes about this, I think says that something is wrong about how little rationality is really floating around, even in a space like Hacker News. I should be relaxing in my backyard while I take my estradiol pill, not typing away and wondering if someone&#x27;s going to accuse me of hurting children one day.<p>Free speech works great if everyone is a rational actor who doesn&#x27;t commit to big ideas without big evidence. Are most people rational most of the time? Consider that the lottery still exists.<p>What about the book? I think people should read it. Don&#x27;t believe the headline. That&#x27;s kinda the problem, is that if you have 1 minute per day to think about trans people, please don&#x27;t spend it on 1 headline that _heavily suggests_ we&#x27;re _associated_ with monsters. I don&#x27;t think the author deserves any sales, so please pirate the book, read the whole thing, _and fact check it_.<p>And once the truth has gotten its shoes on, what do I want you to think? I want you to think, &quot;Wow, it _is_ terrible what happened to those children. Those individual doctors _are_ bad. Those individual trans people in the book _are_ bad. But the fact that ReactiveJelly is trans has _nothing_ to do with _any_ of this. What&#x27;s she gonna do, kick them out? Become Blaire White and constantly emphasize the bad people in a desperate bid to keep her own head above water? Become Contrapoints and write nuanced 2-hour liberal diatribes that no moderate will ever watch? Sit in her backyard and take her pill while quietly accepting that every minority is going to keep catching flack for the crimes of the worst people who happen to share their hashtag?&quot;<p>I hope I don&#x27;t sound agitated.

At 12 cores, though, skylake has a huge lead over a 12 core Graviton2.<p>Similarly, Cascade Lake caps out at around 18 cores. But again at 18 cores the gap between Cascade Lake &amp; Graviton2 is huge.<p>The bottleneck in play here is most likely memory bandwidth.

"The reason so few projects are rewritten in C&#x2F;C++ is that many people know up front that their project will require that performance and just start there.<p>If you are building a high end 3d video game with anything like current fancy graphics no amount of python or ruby is going to make it work. You must start with C or C++ to make effective use of modern hardware (even using the C# unity provides leaves a lot of performance on the table).<p>If you are building a system designed to be faster that some other well defined system then starting with C or C++ is a good idea. If your Java or C# system could handle  1 million transactions a second you might be able to complete 1.5 million&#x2F;s with C++.<p>Some projects never need that level of performance, building those projects on C++ can cost you some time. Most webpages are in that vein, how many hits a day does a typical website get? only a few of the biggest retailers and search engine need that level of performance.<p>That time cost is also shrinking, but not shrinking as fast as I would like. C++11, 14 and 17 it took chunks off development time by polishing some of the sharp corners of the language. Memory leaks are harder to make. Threads and time are easier to work with. Error message are better than ever.<p>There is still progress to make. Every C++ project still needs some time dedicated to configuring the build system. There needs to be some plan for checking for memory issues, there needs to be... I think C++ will continue to get more Rust-like and Rust will continue to grow in popularity and performance. Eventually, I think Rust or something like it will be the preferred high performance language."

If you still want to play that game then restrict the service in other ways. You could for example throttle user upload to 10mbit&#x2F;s if they have uploaded more than 500GB per month.

There is nothing inherently &quot;professional&quot; about using drab and dull interfaces for coding and going to an office where you all dress in identical suits.<p>There <i>is</i> quiet satisfaction in achieving mastery like you mention, but (IMO) it should be accompanied by a pleasant feeling too. GitHub&#x27;s cheerful, bright colors and interface enable that for me, and I&#x27;m grateful to them for it. GitLab and Bitbucket feel flat, dreary, and dull by comparison, honestly. It&#x27;s like going to a brightly colored room with nice sofas v&#x2F;s an all-grey room with a white desk. Which one are you going to be more productive in?<p>I think this is also why Slack is incredibly successful for something that is basically an IRC-in-browser implementation. It made work &quot;fun&quot; for a lot of people and thus steam-rollered opposers."
I think the word &#x27;beloved&#x27; did all the job of an &#x2F;s tag and more.
"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a straight-forward decision and is influenced by a number of things;<p>1. desired time to market.<p>2. operating cost.<p>3. people cost.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing at that level of traffic you&#x27;re not going to go broke unless you lack a decent business model. One of the companies I worked at was spending $100,000+ per month on AWS (more than they should&#x27;ve for the incoming traffic level but they survived for a number of years). A friend was working at another company that was spending $3,000,000+&#x2F;month. The motivation for using DynamoDB&#x2F;Datastore over say S3 is that you <i>can</i> do range queries, field sub-selection, offloading of systems administration, some elements of security, etc.<p>Most traffic patterns have windows and tend to be diurnal in nature. This depends on the number of timezones your service covers. Obvious exception being IoT type time-series. So you might experience peaks of 16k&#x2F;s but that will be for perhaps a few windows in the day. I also wouldn&#x27;t be treating DynamoDB as permanent &quot;long-term&quot; storage for granular data. I would be using a sliding window of whatever I consider to be a valuable retention period (e.g. sliding window of 30 days). If you don&#x27;t you&#x27;d need to scale C* as well.<p>In order to run Cassandra and get streaming aggregation via Spark you need to run &quot;2 regions&quot;. One as the primary online region for serving requests and a second region for stream processing using Spark. Minimum recommended memory requirement is 16GB for a C* node. For a C* + Spark node minimum is 32GB. The more the better for both. If you&#x27;ve selected your keys well C* will scale almost linearly with the addition of nodes. Using Netflix 1,000,000 writes&#x2F;second as a model you could roughly state that dividing nodes (285) by 60 should yield an approximately similar throughput requirement to the articles. So about 5-6 t2.xlarge nodes <i>could</i> potentially work for the FE cluster, and whatever gives you adequate streaming performance for the streaming cluster, as a minimum 3-5 x t2.2xlarge. Let&#x27;s say ~$2,000&#x2F;month.<p>Another thing to consider is that the management and maintenance of a C* cluster doesn&#x27;t come for free either. So figure you&#x27;ll need a minimum of 2 sys-admins to administer the cluster. Depending on where you are that&#x27;ll likely cost the company upwards of $400,000 per year or $33,000k&#x2F;month once you combine base salary, pension contributions, taxes, etc. You could say 1 sysadmin but then you&#x27;re  going to burn out your sysadmins if 1 guy is always on-call.<p>So assuming a sliding window of 30 days that&#x27;s $2,160&#x2F;day for DynamoDB. With a C* cluster you&#x27;re looking at a minimum of $1,100&#x2F;day. More depending on how well it performs for what your system is doing. If you&#x27;re not using a sliding window you&#x27;d also need to scale you&#x27;re C* cluster as well. In order to configure the C* cluster in a way that provides back-ups, auto-recovery, etc you&#x27;re probably looking at about 2w-2m depending on experience. Whereas DynamoDB time to market will be probably a 1-2w."
"In my experience, the double standard usually goes the other way.<p>Many of the liberal arts electives I could choose from (as a physics major) were foundational requirements in that major. For example, in a literature class I took, the instructor was surprised many of us had not also taken Literary Criticism 101.<p>On the other hand, an English major friend of mine was able to take a physics course nicknamed &quot;Physics for Poets&quot;, where rounding g to 10m&#x2F;s&#x2F;s was acceptable."

"At present we&#x27;re in a &#x27;gold rush&#x27; phase, and the rewards from mining result with a large amount of resources being spent on it.<p>Mining rewards will diminish over time so it will no longer be feasible to mine as much as in the &#x27;gold rush&#x27; phase. So the carbon footprint will not be growing all the time.<p>In fact, there&#x27;s a race to make the current hardware to become more power efficient.

"&gt; My mom forgot her gmail password and no longer had the same mobile number for a reset, the secondary reset option was set to my email but would not send a reset despite this.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this before too.  A huge problem right now is the massive tech companies want an unreasonable view into your life.  They want your identity, phone number, photo id, location history, credit history, etc. before they&#x27;ll treat you like a real person.<p>If you think I&#x27;m joking, spin up a transient environment, connect to a VPN, and try to participate online without linking all of your accounts to a piece of real world identity information that, in turn, can be linked to all the other things I listed above.  You can&#x27;t even get an email address without a phone number.<p>Part of the issue there is the huge tech companies are abusing their market positions to assign bad reputation to the IP blocks owned by everyone else.  You can&#x27;t use a VPS for ANYTHING but incoming connections because the IPs are flagged all by Google et al.  How do you run an API server that needs to make any outbound connections if Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. all consider the IP block tainted?  I guess you just need to buy your IPs from Google, right?<p>That&#x27;s exactly the same tactic Google used with GMail.  The original spam filtering was super aggressive and shitty and the solution, according to Google, was to use GMail instead of other providers.  &quot;Get a big provider&quot; is a very poor answer to a question that has a technical solution IMO.<p>&gt; My mailserver is marked as spam by gmail<p>Have you tried GSuite (or whatever they&#x27;re calling it these days)? &#x2F;s"

"I don&#x27;t know which accent you&#x27;re talking about, but I have a strong Indian accent, and one of the major selling points of Google Now is the amazing accuracy with which it works for that! Yes, you have to actually go and set the Voice language to <i>English (India)</i>, because the default <i>English (US)</i> doesn&#x27;t do that great for my accent - but as soon as I switch that, it works really awesome. When we friends sit together, we always compare our Indian English on Google Now v&#x2F;s Siri. All I have to say is Siri is a joke in comparison. Not only does it listen to our accent correctly, it also speaks back all the regional words in the right way they&#x27;re supposed to be spoken which is very comforting."

"&gt; The key really is the CO2 flux rate which wind provides.<p>Indeed. This brings us to the issue of volumes. A useful carbon capture plant needs to capture at least 100 000 tons of CO2 per year (then we need &quot;just&quot; ~ 10 000 such plants). This means each of these minimal plants has to process an air volume of 250 billion cubic meters of air per year. At an air speed of 1 m&#x2F;s (you can&#x27;t flow too fast or there is no time for reaction), and assuming a wildly optimistic 50% capture from the filtered air, you need a reaction area of over 15 000 square meters.<p>Mind you, that&#x27;s the area of the membrane which processes air. Add the auxiliary stuff around it, you can add at least another factor of 100 to the area, so each of your 10 000 plants have to be 1.5x the maximum planned size of the Tesla Gigafactory. And we&#x27;re being optimistic."

"&gt;  The one place where today&#x27;s GPUs aren&#x27;t as good as Toy Story is filtering &amp; anti-aliasing<p>This only makes sense if you are locked in to some texture filtering algorithm already, which isn&#x27;t true.  CPU renderers aren&#x27;t doing anything with their texture filtering that can&#x27;t be replicated on GPUs.  Where the line should be drawn by using the GPUs native texture filtering and doing more thorough software filtering would be something to explore, but there is no reason why a single texture sample in the terms of a software renderer has to map to a single texture sample on the GPU.<p>&gt; BTW, textures &amp; texture sampling are a huge portion of the cost of the runtime on render farms. They comprise the majority of the data needed to render a frame.<p>I&#x27;m acutely aware of how much does or does not go into textures. Modern shaders can account for as much as half of rendering time, with tracing of rays accounting for the other half.  This is the entire shader, not just textures and is an extreme example.<p>&gt; The entire architecture of a render farm is built around texture caching.<p>This is not true at all.  Render farm nodes are typically built with memory to CPU core ratios that match as the main priority.<p>&gt; Just getting textures into a GPU would also pose a significant speed problem.<p>This is also not true.  In 1995 an Onyx with a maximum of 32 _Sockets_ had a maximum of 2GB of memory.  The bandwidth to PCIe 3.0 16x is about 16GB&#x2F;s and plenty of cards already have 16GB of memory.

"That&#x27;s not quite correct. It depends entirely on what jurisdiction&#x2F;s you fall under, where you do business.<p>If you&#x27;re a US entity you can freely store EU data on US servers entirely without EU permission or consent, and do anything with it that you want to (within US law), so long as you don&#x27;t operate within the EU. For exactly the same reason that you can safely ignore GDPR if you don&#x27;t operate in the EU.<p>If I build a service that runs its servers only in the US, in nearly all cases I don&#x27;t need to concern myself with EU laws.

"Going to a body with atmosphere is easier than going to one without. You get free braking (~8500m&#x2F;s of delta-v according to Elon, for Mars) thanks to the atmosphere.<p>Anything without an atmosphere you have to carry the fuel to stop after chasing it down, then land on it slow enough not to die. For robotic missions we can approach these objects in very favorable orbits with transit times measured in years, so the delta-v needed to slow down is manageable.<p>For human-based missions we have to get there fast. Going there fast means you have to dump alot of speed to stop once you get there. Without an atmosphere, that takes fuel. Not as much as it took you to reach that velocity, since you&#x27;re lighter now, but still just about as much in terms of delta-v.<p>I learned this playing KSP. It will open your eyes to the real challenges of orbital mechanics. The hardest planet to land on in the entire game is the one with a mass&#x2F;gravity approaching the game version of earth, except with no atmosphere.

"It takes more rocket to launch into LEO than it does to get a ballistic trajectory to your nearest enemy. Your average ICBM doesn&#x27;t have the oomph to do it. If it did, then it could target any point on the planet, and we are fairly sure the North Korea ICBMs can&#x27;t do that. Yet.<p>Also, once you have got your pellets into LEO, you need a way to spread them with a variety of relative velocity. A satellite-satellite collision or a rocket explosion does this very well - the models give the individual fragments 1km&#x2F;s relative outward velocity from the incident, so you basically need to make a nail bomb. Some of the fragments will be blown in the backwards direction, and may re-enter the atmosphere on the first orbit. Interestingly, because reasons, fragments that are blown upwards and downwards may also re-enter on the first orbit too."
"There are a few things here that <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> surprise me[0], but do.  A credit reporting agency&#x27;s one product is personal data (basically, it&#x27;s you).  Leaking that data basically makes it worthless (or worth a lot less) and besides affecting the people who&#x27;s data was leaked[1], it damages the product of their competitors.  You&#x27;d <i>think</i> that would be something that&#x27;s protected with <i>so many layers</i> that a breach of their web property wouldn&#x27;t make much of a difference[2].<p>At previous employers, without going into terribly much detail, we had an asset that was treated with the kind of security that something like this should have been treated with.  It was on a segregated network that could only be accessed through proxy hosts, requiring two-factor authentication.  The proxy hosts were hardened (only the specific, needed, services&#x2F;components installed&#x2F;running, audited and firewalled to death).  The devices in the secure network could not see the corporate network, let alone the Internet and the corporate network&#x2F;internet could not see these devices.  Even special &#x27;management interfaces&#x27; for corporate devices were segregated.  This was <i>in addition</i> to all of the rigor put in to securing each endpoint.<p>Companies need to realize that security is purely a defense related behavior.  You have to be &quot;perfect&quot; 100% of the time, but your attacker need only be right a small number of times.  The goal is to <i>increase the number of times</i> an attacker has to be <i>right</i> to get at your data.  From ensuring your database accounts can only execute specific things[2], that your web servers are hardened and isolated to limit exposure, to properly configured firewalls (including application-layer firewalls&#x2F;log analysis).  And ensuring that employee access to high-value targets is as minimal as possible and protected thoroughly.  There are both &quot;preventative&quot; and &quot;reductive&quot; technologies that need to be put in place.  Preventative is designed to stop a breach, reductive is designed to ensure that if breached, the breach is either worthless (i.e. proper password hashing) or caught and interrupted before <i>all</i> of the data is exfiltrated.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to explain to investors (and your fellow countrymen) that a couple of million user accounts were exposed than it is to explain that 124 million of them left.<p>From the <i>looks</i> of it, it appears Equifax treats security like most large, non-tech businesses -- an expense that should be cut as deeply as possible.  It&#x27;s probably fitting that they have the word &quot;fax&quot; in their name.  If I had a guess, they probably have mandatory security auditing requirements, they paid the least they could to meet that regulation, and got the answer they paid for (or found someone to give them the answer).  I&#x27;ll also guess that this PIN issue will turn out <i>not</i> to be the worst of the security practices in place -- I mean, how many weeks did they wait to report this[3]?<p>[0] I have a few years&#x27; history at a large corporation working in and around security.  I&#x27;ve seen the ugly, though I feel that we handled things very well (incredibly well compared against Equifax!)<p>[1] i.e. <i>not</i> their customers.<p>[2] I&#x27;m thinking in terms of a typical SQL server, where one can eliminate table&#x2F;view level access in favor of stored procedures that limit what they provide and require a level of knowledge of the operation of the system (and can be tracked by logging in a manner that identifies behavior that&#x27;s not normal).<p>[3] And is it just me being overly cynical or does anyone else think that they waited until a historic hurricane would dominate the news cycle before going public with it?  It was pretty good timing, really -- coming right off of Harvey and right into Irma, it&#x27;s easy to miss this story among the other big news (one &#x27;general news&#x2F;politics&#x27; site that I expected to see <i>all kinds</i> of headlines on had it quite low on the fold for a day and nowhere to be found, today).  Or maybe they were just waiting to give time for more of their higher-ups to sell stock. &#x2F;s"

"&gt; If you&#x27;re building a desktop app that needs to really look good and be fast, why are you using Python?<p>Why not? For an app to feel fast, you need to make it responsive and non-blocking.

Discipline when it comes to not running things on the main thread, using proper async techniques etc. is more important than the number crunching ability of your programming language.<p>And when you need raw speed, you can easily drop in some C++ code with SWIG for example. For example, I made a GUI for controlling an experimental sensor system. The GUI could look boring, but should be rock solid and always responsive, it should be easy to add new features, and it had to read data from PCIe at hundreds of MB&#x2F;s or even faster. So I wrote the GUI in PyQt, the PCIe part in C++. Python allowed me to mock the hardware code out easily so I could test the GUI separately, and made it really easy to read configuration files etc. which is unneccessary painful in C++."

Sure your house never uses enough to matter, but if all of a sudden an auto manufacturer wanted to turn on a whole new production line, they would have planned for that and gotten specific lines run to power it.<p>There is no equivalent for an ISP. Yes, they could guarantee that each customer gets x mbit&#x2F;s and provision enough capacity (both to your house, to your neighborhood, to your central office, and finally to their peering connections) to cover all of that, but your internet would cost $300&#x2F;m whether you use it or not and you&#x27;d be complaining about that too."
"I&#x27;ve been looking for an oscilloscope for almost a decade now.

With modern circuits routinely having signals in the hundreds of MHz that&#x27;s fairly limiting for me.<p>And if I just want to probe &quot;slow&quot; digital signals like SPI or I2C I can get 90% of the features of this module by using a cheap-o ~$10 Saleae clone off aliexpress. It&#x27;s only a digital analyzer but it goes up to 24MHz and with 8 channels you can already do quite a lot of work for a tiny fraction of the price of an entry-level scope.<p>Of course if you do a lot of analog work then a digital analyzer won&#x27;t cut it and the ~$300 price tag for a basic scope is almost a required purchase at this point."

"&gt;Next, let’s consider Mars. Mars is the underlying design case for the Starship, although Starships that go to Mars will probably be of a customized nature. While the Moon takes about 3 days to get to, Mars takes 4-10 months. Launch windows to Mars only open every 2 years, so even if Elon has 1000 Starships ready to go, they can only go every 2 years.<p>and here i think Musk genius of targeting Mars instead of Moon shows again. Moon business case wouldn&#x27;t support, while Mars does support the nuclear powered ships. The Starship is of the size to allow  sufficient shielding for propulsion reactor. To avoid the &quot;once in 2 years launch window&quot; limitation an additional 3km&#x2F;s delta-V is needed, and nuclear will get you that and would speed-up the flight in the standard window. Cutting some time from 3 days for Moon isn&#x27;t really worth the nuclear hassle, cutting half from months long jorneys to Mars and ability to launch practically anytime - that changes everything for Mars. Stacking several Starships - lower ones with reactors, the upper - with people, one can decrease the amount&#x2F;weight for the shielding. Going ionic thrust propulsion powered by the reactors one can  get even faster. All this tech - nuclear propulsion and ionic thrust  - had been tried already, so i think it is no less doable for SpaceX than the Raptor with its hot oxygen resistant superallow."
"Okay, I&#x27;ve got a question for people who work at (or run) a CDN.<p>How the hell do you handle clients who have a 10GBit pipe to the internet?<p>Most data centers only have 40 or 100GBit pipes to the internet, albeit with multiple providers.

"Probably depends on the specs of the cable, and other factors like which port you plug into, cable length, etc.<p>Some people are complaining about how this doesn&#x27;t match expectations, which are that you get the same speed just by using the right shape of cable (and don&#x27;t care about cable specs). I think that the reality is that this is really pushing the envelope, and 40 Gbit&#x2F;s isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> far from typical memory bandwidth (order of magnitude). There are only so many lanes of PCIe to go around, and you&#x27;re going to end up with some ports getting more than others. We already have problems in Ethernet land with the different cat 5e &#x2F; cat 6 &#x2F; cat 7 cables, where bandwidth autonegotiation is mandatory. Most people just want it to work, and if you want your full bandwidth you have to pay attention to the exact specs of every device in the signal path because you can&#x27;t be sloppy the way you could with 100BASE-T or even 1000BASE-T.<p>That&#x27;s a bit of a rant, but I just think that some of the problems with user experience in this area are just down to the fact that this really <i>is</i> a lot of bandwidth to try and push through an external cable, and you end up with the simultaneous goals of having high bandwidth, lots of ports, having all ports be the same, and not charging an arm and a leg for a laptop. Sacrificing bandwidth on a couple ports makes sense to me, in this context.<p>Seems like the user experience pays, cause I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m supposed to know <i>which</i> ports have bandwidth."

Looking from the probe at perihelion, the sun will appear 25 times wider, or 625 times larger, than it does from Earth.<p>And does the fact that AU comes from the earth&#x27;s distance to the sun make it self-centred? Sure, but everyone we need to communicate with would equally find it centred on them. Compared to other measures like &quot;the distance from the king of England&#x27;s nose to the tip of his outstretched finger&quot; it&#x27;s quite neutral."
The Unleashed board has a performance similar to a Raspberry Pi 3 in cpu terms but it&#x27;s biggest bottleneck is that the SD card is running on a SPI bus where it gets something like 2MB&#x2F;s.

"«<i>it should be absolutely trivial to detect how far away the key is based on the response time</i>»<p>It&#x27;s not possible. A keyfob has a relatively slow R&#x2F;F communication channel, less than 1 Mbit&#x2F;s (at best) because it&#x27;s constrained by power. Thus the &quot;length&quot; of a bit transmitted over the air is 300 meters or more. The receiver needs to demodulate &quot;300 meters&quot; of R&#x2F;F signal to recover a single bit. A difference of +&#x2F;- 10 meters when these thieves boost the signal across your front yard is therefore indistinguishable from R&#x2F;F noise and not demodulable by the receiver. You can visualize this as a 300 meter bit that has a noisy beginning and a noisy end.<p>That&#x27;s why the distance-bounding techniques (term we use in the field) used by car manufacturers are instead pretty primitive, such as measuring the strength of the R&#x2F;F signal (which is easily defeated by a proper signal booster.)"

You&#x27;re guaranteed that nothing else will run on the main thread for the duration of an Activity destroy&#x2F;recreate cycle, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about being in some unknown state. If the view was recreated due to a configuration change, rebind your view model&#x2F;s when it attaches. If you&#x27;re being torn down because the user left the retained Fragment&#x2F;Controller&#x2F;whatever the operation was tied to, you&#x27;ll receive an indication of that and you can either send a cancellation signal (e.g. unsubscribe), or if that&#x27;s not possible, have an isDestroyed check where you receive your result to ignore it. If you&#x27;re on the back stack and still alive but have no view (i.e. view NPE), don&#x27;t bind your model immediately - update your view model, and the same code you use to rebind on view reattach will kick in when the user returns and a new view is created and attached."

"Whilst testing like that seems to be possible for granular facts and most likely is a great way to handle these, what about conceptual understanding?<p>The only &quot;surefire&quot; way I&#x27;ve found to test that in myself is written condensing of the concept in a way that allows another person to understand the concept from my notes, or actually explaining the concept to another person.<p>That doesn&#x27;t scale to 20-30 people in a class though since validating that number of explanations is not easy.<p>Random probing using application of the concept however encourages the cooking recipe approach.

They&#x27;re easy to grade, but they don&#x27;t guarantee full understanding.<p>Then there&#x27;s using compound problems, where you start mixing concepts.

First midterm of physics 101 usually leads to a number of exasperated &quot;This wasn&#x27;t covered in class&quot;. Yes it was, just not this specific recipe.

"Empedocles (c. 490–430 BC) was the first to propose a theory of light, and claimed that light has a finite speed. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published his Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing Empedocles emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed. Also in the 11th century, Ab Rayhn al-Brn agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound. In the 13th century, Roger Bacon argued that the speed of light in air was not infinite, using philosophical arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle. In the 17 century, Pierre de Fermat also argued in support of a finite speed of light. In 1629, Isaac Beeckman proposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. The first quantitative estimate of the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer. From the observation that the periods of Jupiter&#x27;s innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, Rømer concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth&#x27;s orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth&#x27;s orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of 220000 km&#x2F;s, 26% lower than the actual value. In his 1704 book Opticks, Isaac Newton reported Rømer&#x27;s calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of &quot;seven or eight minutes&quot; for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8 minutes 19 seconds). Newton queried whether Rømer&#x27;s eclipse shadows were coloured; hearing that they were not, he concluded the different colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729, James Bradley discovered stellar aberration, and from this effect he determined that light must travel 10210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In the 19th century Hippolyte Fizeau developed a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of 315000 km&#x2F;s. His method was improved upon by Léon Foucault who obtained a value of 298000 km&#x2F;s in 1862. In the year 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1&#x2F;00, by discharging a Leyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year Gustav Kirchhoff calculated that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at this speed. In the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space at a speed equal to the above Weber&#x2F;Kohlrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell had proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave, and therefore travelled at the speed c appearing in his theory of electromagnetism. The well-designed experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887 failed to detect a luminiferous aether medium through which electromagnetic waves travelled. Essential to Einstein&#x27;s theories, irregardless of still clinging to the notion of aether, and really because of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Hendrik Lorentz proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly (&quot;local time&quot;), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz&#x27;s aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v&#x2F;c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, Poincaré speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz&#x27;s theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz&#x27;s aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity. To be clear, the modern origin of Relativity is rooted in Poincaré&#x27;s work, and it&#x27;s deeper origins first appears nearly 300 years earlier in the 1632 Galilean Invariance, aka Galileo&#x27;s Theory of Relativity.<p>continues in reply to my own comment..."

The encoding speed is much slower, of course, but not by more than 10x on modern CPUs, typically less.

"I did a quick googling, the earth&#x27;s orbital speed is 29.78 km&#x2F;second, so you&#x27;d need to cancel that out first, then speed up again to match the speed of the asteroid. For comparison, you need 9.4 km&#x2F;s of delta-V to bring something in low earth object (7.8 km&#x2F;s for orbit, plus 1.3-1.8 km&#x2F;s for atmospheric and gravity drag). To put something in counter-rotating low earth orbit, you probably also need to add the rotation speed of the earth (at the location of launch), but, I don&#x27;t know the figures there (not a three second googling away).<p>So uh, yes. Needs a rocket with at least four times as much delta-V as what we currently use to put something in orbit. I&#x27;m reading the New Horizons project, which up until now was the fastest thing to leave Earth, was shooting away from us at 16.26 km&#x2F;s - all from chemical thrust.

"So, such a microbenchmark marks the baseline for how fast you could get via framebuffer.<p>That&#x27;s like 6 ms per frame. If you spend a bit less than two thirds of the time in rendering you could still get 60 fps. But that&#x27;s still just crazy slow.<p>The 175 fps at that resolution comes down to about 20-60 MB&#x2F;s depending on display depth. Memory peak transfer rates were <i>worst like that</i> during the 1990&#x27;s, then several hundreds of MB&#x2F;s for regular speeds in the 2000&#x27;s and are measured in GB&#x2F;s these days.<p>As long as we can reduce framebuffer access to shared memory (to eliminate legacy transfer methods of pixels, if any) there&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t do significantly better. Basically the display controller is reading the memory and the cpu is writing it so we must share some of the bandwidth but still the speeds should be so high that there&#x27;s absolutely no reason we should ever see visual jerkiness on framebuffer graphics, due to hardware."

The server specs and speedtest only require a 1Gbit&#x2F;s port, so you will probably not get higher results than yours anyway.<p>Network speed should generally not be the issue with AWS, it&#x27;s disk iops where the non-local SSDs will make a major impact."

"Running on Kubernetes this is easy, it&#x27;s one of the first issues you hit.<p>Every DNS request for external domains turns into 10 if you don&#x27;t explicitly configure FQDNs (dot at the end). This is because in the default configuration the resolver runs with ndots 5 to search all the possible internal Kubernetes and cloud-provider names. Then you have lookups for IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel. So for every external name you look up, you storm the upstream DNS with 10 requests for non existing domains.<p>Furthermore, the current default DNS service in Kubernetes doesn&#x27;t have any kind of caching for these kinds of lookups (especially not NXDOMAIN) enabled.<p>But like I said, this is one of the first issues you hit running Kubernetes on Amazon. It is widely known and can easily be fixed by scaling up some more instances, changing ndots settings, using FQDNs or configuring caching.

"You&#x27;re missing speeds and acceleration. Comet 67P is a very, very tiny world, with barely the slightest hint of gravity compared to Earth&#x27;s surface. Consider that an ordinary walking speed is about 1 m&#x2F;s. That&#x27;s the escape velocity on 67P. A human could literally jump off the surface under their own power, or they could run into a low orbit (low altitude orbit velocities are 0.7x escape velocities, in general).<p>The speeds and accelerations that we&#x27;re used to in the context of bouncing from the surface within the context of Earth are about ten thousand times greater than on comet 67P. The amount of force generated by Philae&#x27;s collision with the comet&#x27;s surface was very tiny, but it only takes a very tiny force to throw things long distances across the surface of the comet, due to the extremely low gravity (about 1mm&#x2F;s^2)."

"The argument seems to be that the actor model implementations on the JVM aren&#x27;t all that fast and the language can&#x27;t stop you from shooting yourself in the foot.<p>That&#x27;s not really the issue as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Message-passing concurrency actually allows people be productive writing concurrent code that has a hope of working -- that is the main advantage. Occasionally things go wrong. Occasionally you need more performance and have to drop down to a lower level. But I can <i>easily</i> write a web service running on the JVM that gets 1000 requests&#x2F;s per CPU with a bit of message passing concurrency. That&#x27;s the point.<p>Heck, I don&#x27;t even like the actor model -- I much prefer CSP -- but I&#x27;d attack it for other reasons (like lack of type safety)."

"I figured it might be unreasonable, but thanks for responding.<p>Yeah, I was particularly curious because I was unable to find better public offers than AWS (with their homebrew 100Gbit&#x2F;s MPI that drops infiniband&#x27;s hardware-guaranteed-delivery to prevent statically-allocated-buffer issues in many-node setups, allowing them quite impressive scalability) or Azure (with their 200Gbit&#x2F;s Infiniband clusters), at least for occasional batch-jobs.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t ask if I could DIY for less than using AWS, but owning ram is expensive. And for development purposes it would be quite enticing to just co-locate storage with compute, and rent some space on those NVMe drives for the hours&#x2F;days you&#x27;re running e.g. individual iterations on a large dataset to do accurate profile-guided optimizations (by hand or by compiler). Iterations only take a few minutes each, but loading what&#x27;s essentially a good fraction (minus scratch space, and some compression is typically possible) of the ram over network causes setup to take quite a long time (compared to a single iteration)."

"Interesting use of overbooked flights as an example. If I book a flight I better get my seat. And if I don&#x27;t get it because the airline over-provisioned, I don&#x27;t really care about statistically even chances of getting kicked off the airline, especially when the Doctor ends up on YouTube getting his face bashed in while screaming, getting dragged off the flight because he wasn&#x27;t an obedient little citizen. My bigger concern is why they&#x27;re still overbooking seats. STOP OVERBOOKING SEATS. Oh there&#x27;s a federal minimum reimbursement? That&#x27;s great. But what if it&#x27;s not enough for the inconvenience? The government just gave the airline permission to pay me that little and the right to then tell me to fuck off. And if I don&#x27;t, armed government agents enforce the airline&#x27;s screw up.<p>&gt;&gt; The ISP decided to make a contract with you that they would provide you with an n Mb&#x2F;s pipe.<p>No, they made a contract with me that they would, on average provide me with an n Mb&#x2F;s pipe and 6 pages of reasons why it&#x27;s not their fault if at any point in time that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>&gt;&gt; But much more importantly, shouldn&#x27;t it be the responsibility of the ISP to build a network that doesn&#x27;t normally get saturated?<p>Oh I agree - that&#x27;s way more important. I&#x27;d love it if they could make strong guarantees in that regard. And THAT is a problem I&#x27;d like to see the FCC spend more time on than net neutrality. But it&#x27;s not trivial because it&#x27;s not just &quot;giving me a pipe&quot;. It&#x27;s giving my a pipe only some of the way and interacting with other pipes (and with the FCC&#x27;s net neutrality rules, what appears to me to be a poor definition of what a &quot;lawful&quot; destination for the pipe is). Compared to that problem, I just don&#x27;t see why net neutrality is being treated as the final battlefield for a free and open Internet by everybody. If it came with provisions that guarantee lines aren&#x27;t oversubscribed and cleared up the wording on lawful destinations, I&#x27;d be a lot more for it."

"Average is not a good measure for that, because there are lots of hours during the day where even the worst ISPs don&#x27;t have any congestion, and still the connection can be unusable during peak hours.

"As someone who comes from a country where monthly data caps for home internet are completely unheard of and it&#x27;s standard to have internet with download speeds between 5 and 10 MB&#x2F;s for roughly $20&#x2F;month since circa 2006, I find it both puzzling and worrying that capped home broadband can still exist in any developed country, especially with such tiny limits and ridiculous prices that some of the posters here have mentioned.<p>A game can easily get up to 50 GB these days, and a even a single patch can be up to a few GB as well. I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how any sort of work gets done with something like a 500Gb monthly limit in anything above a single person household."

"The reason GHC allocates at such an aggressive rate is the fact that memory allocation is <i>really</i> cheap in GHC. Allocating memory on the GHC heap is literally just bumping the &quot;top of heap ptr&quot;, so writing one word.<p>The idea is that 90% of allocations are very short-lived, so allocating a ton doesn&#x27;t matter as long as you can throw it away cheaply. Suppose we have an inner loop over an array, summing values. We may allocate at 1.6 GB&#x2F;s doing the computation, but everything <i>except</i> the last value is garbage.<p>When we GC we simply copy this last value from the current heap and reset the &quot;top of heap pointer&quot;. Yet another cheap operation.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more going on (generational GC, nursery&#x27;s and what not), but GHC&#x27;s GC heavily abuse some facts that, for example, CRuby cannot, such as the fact that older generations can <i>never</i> reference data in newer generations, so GCing the current generation never has to perform &quot;major GC&quot; (i.e. checking the older data whether it still needs the current generation)."

"&gt; Or am I just a lemur trying to figure out how an airplane works?<p>Unfortunately yes, all of us are.<p>This is not a problem with physics or abstractions. It&#x27;s a problem with our intuition. Our intuition is based on evolution and life experience, which is all formed based on mostly solid objects from 1cm to 100m moving at 1m&#x2F;s to 100m&#x2F;s.<p>The universe however does not care what meatbags can experience with our senses. It doesn&#x27;t mean that our complex math abstractions are necessarily correct - but they are more correct than casual intuition. You can train that intuition with enough work with the maths.<p>For example, you can map most of basic electricity to water flow and pressure, and some electromagnetic waves to waves in water - but you need to make a small jump to abstraction  to combine both, and a large jump to get a gut feeling for special relativity to &quot;feel right&quot;.<p>The crazy part is really that mathematical abstractions exist for all these things at all. There seems to be no natural reason that physics should be describable by small elegant formulas at all, let alone our experience of throwing rocks into a pond.

"&gt; You&#x27;re eliminating the first part of the flight, so the rocket just has to provide the delta-V for orbital insertion, not lift the fuel to do that from sea level.<p>Sure, but the altitude gain is almost &quot;free&quot; - you need to accelerate by something like 6 km&#x2F;s laterally (number pulled out of somewhere, it&#x27;s 2.3 in kerbal space program but the planets are smaller there) and 1 km&#x2F;s vertically (depending on ascent profile, 0 for an instantaneous ascent and infinite for a slow hover upwards, but it ends up something like that), so by Pythagoras it&#x27;s sqrt-37 = really not a lot more than the 6 kms&#x2F;s you&#x27;d have to spend if you could start at 100km altitude.<p>Intuitively we assume rockets go &quot;upwards&quot; partly because that&#x27;s the part we see, but actually the gravity turn occurs very early and most of the acceleration is closer to horizontal.

If the smallest particles of our universe are smaller universes and our universe is a tiny particle within a larger universe, then the speed limit within each could be different.<p>This theory would allow FTL travel in a larger universe relative to the speed limit of our universe, but not FTL communication. FTL travel within one universe may be the escape velocity required to enter the next larger universe outside of the origin universe&#x27;s boundary. But a transmission, originally traveling FTL, sent into a smaller universe may be slowed by its speed limit (similar to light propagating through a non-vacuum medium).

"There are atomic clocks that weigh only about 35 grams. They cost $15K though, so probably too expensive for munitions, except nukes, but fine for aircraft and ships, and probably for some land vehicles. Having ±5.0E-11 accuracy and &lt;1E-11 @1000s short term stability. So enough for any aircraft sortie or ship action in a region of probable GPS spoofing (precise enough for days).<p>Even OCXO will be enough given short duration of stay in a spoofed environment (typical OCXO will give you 50 seconds, but it is more than enough time to be within 300 meters from a spoofer, unless you are on foot). Or 500 seconds within 3000 meters, which is same speed - 6 m&#x2F;s - which you have to maintain to be able to filter out spoofing. Several times more in practice because these are all RMS, not max errors. But 30 m&#x2F;s is 5 sigmas which is military (nuclear, to be precise) definition of &#x27;safe&#x27;, so all aircraft&#x2F;munitions are safe, and ships are big and expensive enough to justify $15,000 atomic clock."
"In an optimized system the bottleneck will be I&#x2F;O. However elements like serialization, many function calls, and extraneous memory copies chips away at performance to the point it matters and its difficult to address these problems directly in languages outside of C&#x2F;C++.<p>Today you can get 15MB&#x2F;s to S3. A not uncommon mysql node might do 10MB&#x2F;s. Good luck trying to push that throughput with python or Ruby on a single process through a http response. Much faster I&#x2F;O exists with sequential HD, SSD, and RAM based I&#x2F;O. Most networks are built with 1Gbit Ethernet allowing 100MB&#x2F;s that won&#x27;t get saturated in the slower languages without going parallel which can increase total system complexity and lines of code."

"That was bad luck with the downvoting, I have heard the gravitational narrative of stellar evolution and element creation before, perhaps in a Feynman lecture? I recall the idea that a cloud of hydrogen atoms has more gravitational potential than the equivalent cloud of heavier elements, basically because the matter is more evenly dispersed. It seems to make a certain sense. Particles get very fast when they close distance, if they can then stick together their kinetic energy has to become something. Interesting to calculate the gravitational energy involved in a neutron and proton getting close enough to be held by each others nuclear forces, beginning from an average separation of say a few microns? I know they have to get through repulsive nuclear forces in order to stick, I don&#x27;t know if the reaction always liberates kinetic energy. Maybe it depends on what element results.<p>An interesting topic of stellar fusion should be supernova reaction&#x2F;s. The creation of heavier elements there can clearly release enough kinetic energy to explode the condensed body. Does that energy owe to the distance that has been closed by particles forming heavier elements, or to loss of mass in the nuclear reactions?<p>I wonder about the gravitational energy of a cloud of billard balls rather than atoms. If another cloud has the same volume but half the number of larger balls that are twice as heavy. I guess if the two clouds have the same size, weight and density, they have the same gravitational potential - if they start cold, they will both implode with the same force at the center. But this seems to contradict the narrative that conversion of hydrogen to helium should consume or liberate that potential energy."

"Why exactly do existing video streaming solutions use such small amounts of bandwidth and have terrible quality as a result? Does anyone have a deep dive into why this is the case? It seems that it would be a killer feature to make better utilization of bandwidth.<p>Even over wifi, speedtest shows 4ms&#x2F;100mb&#x2F;100mb on my internet connection, but Zoom, FaceTime, and others never use more than about 0.8Mbit&#x2F;s for a video stream, and the resulting quality of audio and video is...understandably poor.<p>Latency too totally feels like a software problem, perhaps with too many layers of abstraction.

"Support. Ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with linode, do, and aws over the years. I&#x27;ll skip do as they&#x27;re fairly similar to linode but I haven&#x27;t used them enough to have explicit examples, and will therefore compare linode and aws.<p>Off the bat, you get a lot more bang for your buck at linode, in terms of compute and storage. If you&#x27;re running a single server, don&#x27;t care too much about what&#x27;s on it or having many nines of uptime - go for linode. I still use them for hosting a few dinky personal projects.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to do more though, say something involving hundreds of instances and thousands of interactive requests per second, and every second of downtime means real pain, then raw compute is far from your only consideration.<p>When we had dire issues with jitter on the xen packet scheduler with linode which was causing memcached requests to get stuck linode support really tried, but drew a blank - we had to tell them the solution and beg them to implement it, which they did - but it took a month, and it cost customer confidence, revenue, my sanity. It&#x27;s little things like being limited to 50Mb&#x2F;s node interconnect that make life unnecessarily hard. I absolutely understand why that was the case there, and was very grateful to the folks there tweaking our XPS settings so we wouldn&#x27;t end up with our packets essentially being quantised, but it was the kind of thing that you really don&#x27;t want to have to deal with - like moving into a house (admittedly running a heavy industry out of it), and then finding that the windows emit gamma rays on Tuesday when it rains - it took an absurd amount of work to figure out what was going on.<p>We moved to AWS in the wake of this and other similar issues. Big. Bureaucratic. Expensive. Reliable. Knowledgable. Cheaper than failure.<p>While since moving to aws we saw occasional and sometimes substantial weirdness within amazon&#x27;s stack, they would always escalate and resolve major issues very swiftly. The longest we ever waited was a week, on something that required a global change, as we&#x27;d discovered a major problem with failure behaviour of one of their beta services. They talked to us every day. The management tools and api are comprehensive, the ecosystem encompasses most services you might want but doesn&#x27;t get in the way of rolling your own, and they&#x27;re remarkably flexible in what they&#x27;ll reconfigure for you if you ask with a good reason. Paying £100k+ a month probably didn&#x27;t hurt either.<p>The long and the very short is that you aren&#x27;t purely paying for hardware when renting compute, you&#x27;re paying for everything surrounding it. AWS cost more, but for the peace of mind of being able to straddle AZs easily and to know that if something on their end goes bang they&#x27;ll fix it quick it&#x27;s worth it.<p>We managed 97% uptime on linode over two years, five nines on aws.<p>Oh, and as an aside - when you&#x27;re selling a SaaS solution, your customers have a lot more confidence when you say the basement iron is Amazon, rather than &quot;sorry, can you repeat that? Lipode? Lytrode?&quot;.<p>I really don&#x27;t want to bash the linode guys - Chris was really helpful in the early days, and the personal touch was awesome,  I saw a lot in their &quot;DNA&quot; that was like ours, and as above, I do still use their service - but AWS is kinda in a league of its own when it comes to provisioned compute services."
"Actually, this holds only up to certain extent. Synchronization, locking, memory access patterns and context-switching from many threads with accompanied cache thrashing can bring the effective parallelization to very small levels.<p>I remember from benchmarking a high performance transactional messaging system in Java I was working on seeing how it hit a flat line at some point where it didn&#x27;t scale at all due to CPU&#x2F;memory contention (this depended on maximal number of threads allowed). We had to look at alternative designs such as 0MQ to see how they overcame it - basically they put one working&#x2F;client thread per core to achieve their 1M messages&#x2F;s. We were using 10s of thousands of threads in our middleware when necessary, and that was faster than async NIO in Java 6 at that time."
"&gt; K8S doesn&#x27;t eliminate the workflow for &quot;deployments, upgrades, monitoring, etc..&quot; it just black boxes them. It also assumes out of the gate that everything needs to be able to do HA, scale for 1,000,000 instances&#x2F;s etc...<p>What I&#x27;ve seen, anecdotally, is that many ops-background people don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; why kubernetes is such a big deal. They assert rightfully that they can already do everything, they already know how to do everything, and they can do it without the overhead (both cognitively and in terms of resource utilization) of k8s.<p>But, if you are <i>writing</i> and <i>deploying</i> code - especially if you&#x27;re not in a terribly agile organization - k8s eases so many real pain points that &quot;old&quot; models have which ops teams may be only vaguely aware of. If you need a certain dependency, if you need to deploy any new software, an entire new language or approach, if you need a new service, you now have the ability to directly do it immediately.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you what a big deal it is going to be for a developer at a random bigco to be able to run their code without waiting for ops to craft a VM with all the right bits for them.<p>k8s solves real problems. If you have a monolith and need to solve how to scale it, that&#x27;s not where k8s shines. But with lots of small workloads, or dynamic workloads, or existing dev vs ops organizational hurdles, it can really be a game changer."

Keep in mind it&#x27;s for graph processing - Hadoop&#x2F;HDFS still shines for data-intensive streaming workloads like indexing a few hundred terabytes of data - where you can exploit the parallel disk io of all disks in the cluster - if you have 20 machines with 8 disks in a cluster that&#x27;s 20 * 8 * 100mbyte&#x2F;s = 16gbyte&#x2F;s throughput - for 200 machines it&#x27;s 160gbyte&#x2F;s.<p>However for iterative calculations like pagerank the overhead for distributing the problems is often not worth it.

Horizontal scaling is not what these databases do as mentioned (thinking of Wonderware, IP.21, Honeywell, PI, ...).

"&gt; <i>DDR4 RAM is quite expensive, though.</i><p>True, but it is a major upgrade.<p>The i7-3770 supports two channels of DDR3-1600 memory, or 25.6 GB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth.  A Ryzen processor (or other recent generation) supports DDR4-3200, which literally doubles your memory bandwidth.  Fortunately or unfortunately, we now have much faster PCIe SSDs so memory bandwidth isn&#x27;t as crucial for normal use, but a 100% improvement is a much better reason to upgrade than a measly 10% bump."

"My thoughts exactly.<p>I&#x27;m under the impression that e.g. wind power should not be built at all for electricity production (output is just too little) but all the subsidies it enjoys makes it a worthwhile business. Considering whether this is true is difficult because the facts are intentionally obscured and for example the wind power capacity is often at some nominal wind speed which is often a lot more than the average at the location. In my home country, a 1MW wind turbine was built but the nominal output is at 13 m&#x2F;s while the average wind speed is around 6 m&#x2F;s, yielding about an eighth of the nominal power (proportional to the speed cubed).<p>The same is true for photovoltaics as the raw materials need a huge volume of earth to be mined for a miniscule amount of material.<p>Nuclear isn&#x27;t any different, it&#x27;s hard to get facts from uranium mining and enrichment, especially given its military value and the surrounding secrecy.<p>For this reason, I usually refrain from any energy policy discussion.

"I run a not too small hosting ISP today, and ten years ago I used routers based on commodity hardware running OpenBSD. Back when we were at Gbps scale and most customers were on 100Mb links, this worked fine. However, it did not scale to 10Gbps+, let alone the 100Gbps+ of capacity we&#x27;re at today.<p>Beside the obvious case of performance not keeping up in aggregate, performance for just customers being on 1Gbps links was not as good. We found individual TCP session throughput routed through commodity hardware was noticeably lower than using a layer 3 ASICS based switch despite various attempts at tweaking various kernel sysctl variables.<p>Also, because nobody operates commodity based hardware routers at carrier scale, you cannot trust any open source BGP daemon&#x27;s implementation of BGP confederations if they even have it at all. At that, I wouldn&#x27;t really trust any vendor other than Cisco or Juniper for carrier scale routing.<p>So even if someone were to create a popular, open source routing project making use of DPDK to increase performance scalability on commodity hardware, I&#x27;d still stick to Cisco or Juniper solutions like CSR 1000V or vMX for the foreseeable future if I really wanted to use commodity hardware, as the full feature set is going to be proven and mature. I&#x27;d want to see any new product stand up well for 5+ years at carrier scale production use before I&#x27;d give it any serious consideration.<p>Even then, I&#x27;m not sure how well DPDK will stand up to UDP reflection volumetric type attacks which now dominate DDOS. The top packets&#x2F;s levels achieved are barely sufficient for simple routing, and would likely drop precipitously with a modest ACL in place, in comparison to ASICS based routers being able to still do full line rate with ACL&#x27;s that have a large number (hundreds) of terms."

"<i>My personal conclusion (as much as people shout at me otherwise) is that geek communities quietly realize they are top-1% users and their usage patterns are subsidized by everybody else</i><p>It is true that many of the people reading this thread are top bandwidth users <i>overall</i>, but I question whether their peak-hour contribution to e.g. Netflix congestion is any more or less than the average Netflix subscriber.

"&gt; the speed of light is only guaranteed to have a value of 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s when measured by an inertial observer in a vacuum.<p>This is the average speed of photons in vacuum, right? Because according to the quantum field theory, photons should have a probability of hitting virtual particles that popped into existence, which would slow it down a little."
"I hope this clarifies the appartent contradiction.  Light can&#x27;t help but move at any other speed than c = 2.997 x 10^8 m&#x2F;s.  It can&#x27;t go faster, nor slower.  So how does the speed of light appear to slow down in certain circumstances?  In a vacuum, the speed of light is always c.  There is nothing to interfere with the propogation of the individual photons (little atoms of light) as they move through the vacuum.  However, in a material such as glass the individual photons of light are absorbed and reemitted many trillions of times by the molecules making up the glass.  The photons do a &quot;stop over&quot; and don&#x27;t move at all, the velocity of these photons is zero (actually the photons temporarily don&#x27;t exist except as energy absorbed by the atoms in the glass).  Between lattice points or individual atoms the photons travel at velocity c.  The combination of stop overs (absorbtion and reemission events) and free propogation gives the appearance light is travelling at a slower overall velocity than c."

"&gt; this is income inequality, generational wealth, and the racial wealth gap all rolled into one.<p>To put that disparity into specific financial terms.<p>According to the Federal Reserve, the average white US household crossed the $1 million net worth line sometime in the past two years with the climb by the stock market and property values. Emphasis that that is the average, the median is closer to $190k-$210k, which is comparable to some of the wealthiest median household wealth nations such as Belgium, Australia and Switzerland.<p>The median white household wealth figure is only surpassed by the median asian household figure (asian households still trail white households on the average figure; due to a difference in duration of time to accumulate larger generational wealth).<p>The average black US household has an average net worth of about $150k for 2018, and a median of about ~$20,000. The Fed&#x27;s figure is generally that black US households have less than 15% the wealth of white and asian households.<p>The average hispanic US household has an average net worth of about $200k for 2018, and a median of about ~$22,000.<p>Of note, as you&#x27;d expect there&#x27;s an enormous difference in all households when it comes to education and wealth attainment. The average white household net wealth figure hits about $2 million where the lead earner has a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher; without that education level, the average wealth figure for white households is about 20% that (roughly $400k). In black households, a stark example of the importance of education attainment is that the median wealth figure increases by seven fold in households where the prime earner&#x2F;s have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. In hispanic households with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, the average household wealth figure is around $650k (a great figure for most any wealthy nation). That hispanic demographic saw about a 60% (!) increase in their net worth between 2013 and 2019. Every way you look at the education vs wealth figures it puts an emphasis on the huge gap in wealth between households with more education vs less.<p>Besides the giant budget deficit problem, I don&#x27;t see any scenario where taxes (on capital gains, income and estates) on the top ~10% don&#x27;t go up a lot over the next 10-15 years or so. The largest lever the government is perceived to have to go after wealth disparity is aggressive wealth redistribution through taxes.<p>You of course also see this gap in other nations like France and the UK (which have some of the highest median household wealth levels), where they have very poor minorities with high unemployment rates and little personal or household wealth.<p>Social cohesiveness obviously falters in situations where you have such wealth disparities over time. That&#x27;s particularly true if you have the triple hit of little economic growth, aging demographics and ever rising social demands (an increasingly common scenario in developed nations today)."

Both do generally good in the private sector after they&#x27;re done with it.<p>As usual the people graduating from public schools will say the private graduates don&#x27;t have the theorical foundation, and the private graduates will say the public graduates don&#x27;t have enough technical skills when they graduate. In reality the decent students will pick up the theory from the practical projects and vice-versa.<p>If that matters, I did Epitech, which is similar-ish to 42 and all the people that graduated with me have decent positions and are in high demand by the job market. Some of them in big name companies.<p>This kind of private schools are a good alternative for people who don&#x27;t fit in the public education by letting them just do practical projects with some direction and let them pick up the theory from there. Some people are really good self taught hackers but would otherwise drop out in typical education, but they can shine in these schools. I&#x27;ve met many."

"Considering Benjamin Franklin in other writings has shown a much more enlightened view of Indians, this passage you quoted might have been written with sarcasm and this is an earlier example of Poe&#x27;s law. This passage has more to do with the virtue of temperance and rum than indians. This passage is more like objectively talking about how the CIA worked to help import cocaine in the United States in the 80s and how African American communities like Harlem were being destroyed because of the crack epidemic because of these policies of the government.<p>This passage edited for 2019 internet should read.<p>&#x27;The next day, sensible they had misbehav’d in giving us that disturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology. The orator acknowledg’d the fault, but laid it upon the rum; and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying, ”The Great Spirit, who made all things, made everything for some use, and whatever use he design’d anything for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when he made rum, he said, ‘Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with,’ and it must be so.“<p>And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means. It has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the sea-coast.&#x27; &#x2F;s"
Stage I of a Saturn V contributes a maximum of about 3600 m&#x2F;s of delta-v.

It takes a lot more if the first stage rocket is reusable.

They also have a precision on the 100&#x27;s of µm, but let&#x27;s push it down to 10&#x27;s here so we overestimate things by an order of magnitude.<p>That means they&#x27;ll need around 1000 codes&#x2F;s, with a minimum of 64kbps on the 8 character case, or 72kbps with my codes. I don&#x27;t think there is any serial interface chipset on the market that can&#x27;t do 512kbps even on a 100&#x27;s of meters long cable. Not to say that everything nowadays runs over USB anyway.<p>The gcodes are a leggacy that isn&#x27;t needed anymore. And since both sides of the CNC link are composed of overpowered computers doing anything on software, the only reason it didn&#x27;t change already is because nobody bothered to do something better.

The house may think that the mechanics of the human are infinitely more complex (i.e. the wiring of the house barely compares to a handful of neurons from the human), but from the perspective of the human there is nothing complex about the interaction. For the house to be self-bootstrapping from just soup would be curious and highly unlikely from their POV.<p>As a human our reasoning ability is influenced by our viewpoint (and that&#x27;s not to say any one viewpoint is right or wrong), so we should always play devils advocate with the razor."

"The TechEmpower Benchmarks measures the maximal number of requests per second you can churn through a server.

You need 10.000 connections, each running 3 req&#x2F;s for 30.000 req&#x2F;s. So we are not trying to maximize the system. We are trying to saturate it over a long period with a constant load. And you need to use wrk2 (also from Gil Tene) because otherwise the load generator and the System-under-test ends up coordinating among themselves, hiding the fact that some of the 10.000 connections are starved to get more req&#x2F;s through on a subset.<p>The Java frameworks are very very good at handling 512 connections and throwing as many requests through those as possible. What they fail at, is 10.000 connections. What usually happens in bad load generators is that they allow the Java code to starve, say 9500 of those connections while getting all the good numbers on the last 500. wrk2 doesn&#x27;t allow that to happen, and starvation is counted against the SUT.<p>As for the source, you would have to wait.

That is, my opinion is the overwhelming majority of the the factor&#x2F;s that get you from 75 to 100 or more, are genetic (and if you don&#x27;t have super longevity genes, almost nothing will get you to ~100)."
"The ISP&#x27;s feel like, burden or not, since Netflix represents more of the traffic they should pay more of the infrastructure cost.

"MooseFS and BeeGFS don&#x27;t really seem to be in the same category of filesystem though.<p>BeeGFS comes from the HPC world where it is all about performance, while MooseFS seems more focused on high reliability even in the face of entire machines coming and going.<p>BeeGFS stores files striped over multiple machines and can use infiniband natively which gives us a system where bandwidth to individual files can reach a bit over 1GB&#x2F;s (best case) and aggregated bandwidth can reach 30GB&#x2F;s from a very mixed and unoptimized bioinformatics workload, a lot more when just testing the raw bandwidth.<p>Since BeeGFS uses an underlying filesystem on each storage target you can of course run raid, zfs or whatever it takes to make you comfortable that the individual storage targets aren&#x27;t going to be lost - which is what it takes for data to be unavailable.<p>If you want some extra reliability in BeeGFS it also supports mirroring so you only lose data if you fully lose two storage targets.

"Colocation seems to have fallen out of favour over the past decade, but it still provides the most bang per buck for server performance.  The only difference is that provisioning takes weeks to months vs seconds to minutes via an API call.<p>Where this has the most impact on performance and cost is visible in storage systems.  Low tier solutions on AWS have notoriously bad storage performance.  20MB&#x2F;s is useless for just about anything modern."

"The assertion that JSON parsing is faster than I&#x2F;O for most applications does not match my experience. First, achieving 10 GB&#x2F;s consistent throughput for I&#x2F;O on a server is pretty ordinary these days. If your systems are designed for performance and efficiency, parsing JSON with throughput that will saturate the I&#x2F;O capacity is a challenge. Second, a lot of JSON that gets parsed in applications isn’t transiting I&#x2F;O at all, it is in memory and only a subset of what is parsed may transit I&#x2F;O. In these cases, there is an even higher bandwidth threshold for peak performance — memory bandwidth.<p>I’ve profiled many applications that were completely and thoroughly bottlenecked on JSON parsing, even when care was taken to not be profligate with JSON parsing because everyone knows it is quite slow."

"&gt; My taxes have frequently paid for US Gov led torture. If we ever hold China accountable in a meaningful way, it won&#x27;t be due to authentic moral outrage.<p>Interestingly your premise is a form of forever torture that forever punishes and condemns entire nations of people even if they weren&#x27;t directly (or even indirectly) responsible for the actions of a small group of people.<p>Every American is denied the ability to have authentic moral outrage because of what a very small number of people did eg at Abu Ghraib? I disagree. That&#x27;s an absurd premise and it means a nation can never change its behavior or move beyond past mistakes. In fact, your premise encourages a nation to never change, because you&#x27;re forever condemned no matter what you do.<p>It&#x27;s a collectivist punishment system. The kind of thing that has been used to apply inherited or associative morality based on nation, group or race for thousands of years. It&#x27;s straight out of the old testament.<p>Let&#x27;s examine that however. So because of things that happened in the past, or things outside of your direct control, a person or government decades or centuries later can never hold a position of &quot;authentic moral outrage.&quot; How about people that were disgusted by acts of US torture and voted their conscience accordingly (electing Obama instead of the war hawk McCain, for example), do they get to have authentic moral outrage? Can you clarify how your all-powerful god-like moral ruling works in practice?<p>The French can never have authentic moral outrage because Napoleon murdered millions of people and the French did horrible things in Vietnam? Is there an expiration timer on any of this?<p>The Russians can never have authentic moral outrage because of what happened under the USSR and because of what Putin is doing currently?<p>The people of Belgium are forever condemned to never possess authentic moral outrage because of King Leopold II?<p>The people of Cambodia can possess no authentic moral outrage, regardless of their involvement in the genocide and that condemnation shall last an eternity.<p>The Germans....<p>Shall I continue? These are all intentionally extreme examples to make a very obvious point.<p>The world found out about Abu Ghraib, and the US was shamed, humiliated, and Obama issued an executive order specifically banning the CIA&#x27;s torture techniques in 2009 in response. The NDAA of 2016 also further restricted abusive interrogations. The people of the US were widely disgusted. It was very public as a matter, it was broadcast to the American people 24&#x2F;7 for months. Culturally we had a large, very public debate over it as a nation. That was for a few dozen cases of torture. The world&#x27;s superpower - which needed to have zero concern for the world&#x27;s opinion - was very clearly humiliated by it and took action to prevent torture in the future (and yes, one can be reasonably skeptical of that being successful; as time goes on the US should be judged by its actions and not words on the matter).<p>Why should a nation of people or its large government&#x2F;s be comprehensively denied &quot;authentic moral outrage&quot; because of the actions of an exceptionally small part of the population? A plainly absurd position to take on how morality should work."

"I found a figure of 0.4 cpb for xoshiro256++. AES-128-CTR using AES-NI runs at over 10 GB&#x2F;s per core on a 3900X. That&#x27;s approximately the same throughput. Of course, performance embedded in a real simulation may differ wildly, I expect xoshiro is much, much friendlier to frequent invocations generating a block each than AES, so to reach that throughput with AES you&#x27;d likely need a not-so-small buffer, which eats into L1 and L2 cache budgets."

"<i>a mere 1 req&#x2F;s from 100 hosts</i><p>I specifically set a request number that would be below most thresholds.<p>That said, a <i>one-time</i> request from 100 hosts would still use 100 CPU-seconds of work.  Other than preemptively blocking hosts (such as all of AWS), there is no way that a &quot;per-ip attempt throttle&quot; is going to catch a single request from 100 different hosts.<p>If you had a server with maxed out with 8 intel E7-8870V2 CPUs (15 cores @ 8 CPUs = 120, $32k server cost just in CPUs), and set for a work factor that gave a normal &quot;1 second&quot; work factor, then someone just DOS&#x27;d you for most of a second.  On a more reasonable 8 core server, that DOS would last 12.5 seconds (actual CPU time, not including the fact that they are stacked on top of each other).  And on a dual core system that&#x27;s almost 2 minutes.<p>If there was any other part of a website that could be DOS&#x27;d for so long with so few requests, then most people would also suggest the application had &quot;far more gaping holes in it.&quot;  Moxie&#x27;s point above is that the advice presented is to just put bcrypt&#x2F;scrypt&#x2F;PBKDF2 in place, and no advice is given at all on how to deal with these issues that come up, or even that they exist at all, and thus systems end up being misconfigured or work factors relaxed to a point where only a false sense of security is gained."
"Pure speculation but you can get and click a VPS&#x2F;dedicated server with a 1Gbit&#x2F;s  pipe almost everywhere.

"The speed of light is not a speed limit on effective travel, but on observation. Imagine you build an engine that gives enough thrust to roughly produce an extra effective 1km&#x2F;s of velocity each time you operate it. Even though the speed of light is 300km&#x2F;s, that engine is going to operate exactly the same on the 301st operation as it did on the first operation. And, in fact, in &#x27;real&#x27; terms if we create an engine capable of generating 1g of thrust for years at a time - we could travel 700 light years in ~12 years by thrusting for 1g forward 6 years, turning around and then thrusting for 6 years backwards.<p>But of course the &#x27;catch&#x27; is that time dilation (and length contraction) kick in. And so while from the frame of reference of the ship and all its travelers only 12 years will have passed, from the frame of reference of everybody back on Earth - 700 years would have passed. What we would <i>observe</i> is that as the ship approached the speed of light, its apparent mass would approach infinity, reaching a velocity asymptote at the speed of light.<p>And these values are also not linear. It&#x27;s possible to travel a practically unlimited distance in the span of a single human lifetime - from the perspective of that human. 100 trillion light years would take about 62 years at 1g from the perspective of those on board our ship. There&#x27;s also really really fun paradoxes available here. Imagine somebody leaves Earth towards this planet and at some point decades, or perhaps even centuries later, we develop technology that enables substantially faster travel. Our planetary settlers on their 12 year journey could arrive 12 years later to find that not only is the planet indeed colonized, but it&#x27;s colonized by the descendents of Earthlings that left decades, or even centuries, after they did.<p>The really exciting thing here is that NASA seems to have gone silent on the EM drive after having it pass every single test they threw at it.

If the EM drive somehow actually works - and everything we know says it most certainly should not - that would change absolutely everything. The ability to actually start realistically considering these sort of missions would be mundane compared to other possibilities, which I&#x27;m not even going to get into as they sound, and should be, absurd. As an aside, this part on the EM drive is 100% speculation - not to be confused with everything stated above, which are direct and heavily tested (even if absurd sounding) consequences of relativity."

"Sounds like a great project for someone to work on.<p>You know, those Mastodon folks have built some interesting stuff on top of ActivityPub. Maybe we should build a text-based communication protocol on ActivityPub in addition to more social features. Then we could also give some file-sharing mechanism, wherein a user could send a message with a tightly linked file, like the message and file are attached to one another.<p>Then we could let users run a server to send these sorts of messages over a federated ActivityPub network.<p>Perhaps we could normalize this protocol so much that ISPs would include a basic option of an address and some storage.

I can&#x27;t remember where Telstra&#x27;s ownership stopped whether it was to the first in-house socket or to the curb. It&#x27;s all a bit irrelevant now as NBN owns the network and its problems.<p>Because what NBN is finding is that the last bit of copper is actually responsible for a lot of the problems. And so even though FTTC for example should be seeing significantly better results than FTTN in fact it isn&#x27;t the case. So much so that NBN is looking at whether to go into people&#x27;s houses to fix up the wiring.<p>FTTC is definitely a better option than FTTN especially since with G.Fast you are able to attain 1Gbit&#x2F;s speeds.

"Apple puts GPUs in these things? Sorry, I thought it only put  Intel Irises. &#x2F;s"
"Ignore the `1080 Ti`s and go for `EVGA 1070 FTW Hybrid`.
They are watercooled and can easily do 30MH&#x2F;s so in current ETH difficulty they&#x27;ll give you around 2.46 ETH per Month.<p>They will also greatly reduce the price of the rig."
I just installed Cocoapods last night and tried to clone down the repo.  It took about 5 minutes and I thought to myself &quot;Is my 150MB&#x2F;s connection slow?&quot;  This definitely clears up what was going on.
One of the Boston bombers was captured.<p>&#x2F;s
Avocados have to be harvested green since there is only about a 45 minute window of ripeness before they are hopelessly rotten. &#x2F;s

"Err, no.  The SATA 3.0 spec is 6.0 Gb&#x2F;s.  Most NIC&#x27;s might run 1Gb&#x2F;s locally, but once you hit the WAN you&#x27;re probably talking about 10 or 100Mbit.<p>Network storage has always been slower than local, and until we get 10Gb to the home, will continue to be so."
"Sure, so which subset of HTML are we talking about?<p>Because unless I&#x27;m misremembering things, HTML 2.0 (literally the first version intended to be a standard going forwards) came out exactly the same year that JS dropped in a commercial browser (1995), and superseded the previous HTML and HTML+ markups.<p>So surely you don&#x27;t mean HTML with things like file uploads, or GIF support.

There&#x27;s quite a few units defined already that I&#x27;m usually pleasantly surprised. This also works on iOS.<p>The one downside is you can&#x27;t do unit conversions of a mathematical expression, just of a number.

"Because it&#x27;s a really really bad idea, for several reasons.<p>1. If your rocket has a failure during launch, you&#x27;re likely to spread the nuclear waste over a large land area.<p>2. Even though we really haven&#x27;t generated that much nuclear waste, it&#x27;s still many many rocket-launches-worth. That gets expensive. Much more expensive than sticking it in a hole in the side of a mountain.<p>3. Launching something into the sun takes a <i>huge</i> amount of rocket fuel. It takes a Falcon-9 with a mass of ~550Mg to get a payload of ~22.8Mg into low earth orbit with a velocity of ~8km&#x2F;s. The Earth is moving around the Sun at ~30km&#x2F;s, so to launch into the Sun, you need to depart from the Earth at (at distance) ~30km&#x2F;s. Earth&#x27;s escape velocity is ~11km&#x2F;s, which means that from low earth orbit, you need to get up to ~32km&#x2F;s (sqrt(30^2 + 11^2)). So your ~22.8Mg payload in low earth orbit needs to include a rocket that can add ~24km&#x2F;s to its velocity. If we assume a rocket with a fairly decent engine, with an Isp of 4km&#x2F;s, then we can plug that into the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. The remaining payload that can be flung into the Sun is a grand total of 57kg. All the rest of that ~22.8Mg is rocket fuel. Per SpaceX Falcon-9 launch. This is not an effective way to get rid of nuclear waste. (Note, it may be possible to increase efficiency by making use of gravity assists from other planets, but you still need to actually <i>get</i> to other planets first, so a pretty hard limit on the payload-into-the-Sun is the payload-to-Mars, which is ~4Mg. Still not very much.)"

"It comes down to when you need to anything with ZFS but simply use it for data storage.<p>Expanding a RAID vdev is not possible, instead the recommendation is to waste 50% of storage for a pool of mirrored devices to get the same protection as a RAID1 of two drives, which isn&#x27;t much for some people.<p>For the avarage home user, such a scaling option is already no longer viable.<p>This is topped with ZFS&#x27; poor performance under low RAM conditions. FreeNAS barely managed 10MB&#x2F;s when running with 2GB of RAM and an old Pentium 4 Dual Core. Not everyone can afford to throw hardware at the problem.<p>On the other hand, Linux performs under the same conditions with 8 times the speed for simply copying files and mdadm&#x2F;lvm&#x2F;unraid allow me to dynamically grow the pool of harddrive space a single drive at a time.<p>(plus mdadm&#x2F;lvm is included in basically every larger distro by now, no need to install it or compile support into the kernel)"

"Another factor is that these consumer Optane products only have 1 or 2 chips to multiplex operations across. Their enterprise product, the SSD DC P4800X uses 28 of the same 16GB chips and can read or write at ~2GB&#x2F;s which is competitive with NVMe SSDs."

"This subject is interesting to me. I&#x27;ve worked remote my entire career, and mostly positive experiences. One negative experience was at a place struggling to fill positions and opened up to remote team members, but they did not change the company culture to support the remote members, and as a result all of the remote members were gone within a year or two and the experiment deemed &quot;a failure&quot;.<p>So I understand why some companies are reluctant to bring on remote members. It requires your entire company culture to change if you want a remote team member and not just someone used as basically contract labor. For a team used to making decisions and having conversations in person, it&#x27;s a big change to have to move everything online to include the remote person&#x2F;s. It can breed resentment on both sides. In my negative experience I would find out decisions had been made days ago while the on-site team was out to lunch together, and no one had informed those of us working remotely.<p>Change is not easy. Companies that started with a remote workflow or commit fully to embracing a remote workflow can make teams located anywhere work. Adding on remote team members without a culture change to support it is a recipe for disaster."

The pi4 has USB 3 which internally is connected via PCIe, but the question is whether it could handle eg SATA and Ethernet on it. Not that I actually need this for anything, it would just be cool to have a small case with 1TB SSD that you can plug into a switch and deliver hundreds of MB&#x2F;s.

"Not so much about misunderstanding as it is about omitting other details. For one, IOS is a completely closed box whereas AOSP is completely open. You can argue for or against security by obscurity v&#x2F;s security in open software, but at the very least it needs a mention in any fair comparison. Secondly, most of the blog focuses on average case behaviour. In Apple&#x27;s case the average, best and worst case are all the same since they make only one device and one OS. In contrast, android is a vast spectrum. Now if you were to give out advice to people with sensitive data, you should compare the best case for both of them, which he briefly does, but not quite as detailed as it warrants. For instance, is iphone necessarily better than a Pixel running AOSP or something like CopperheadOS ? I&#x27;m not so sure. IOS&#x27;s centralized behaviour also makes it an easier target in some ways. Want to attack all browsers on an iphone ? Attack webkit. There are other security fails such as relying on either itunes or icloud for getting data in and out of the phone. Much fuss was made over Cloudfare&#x27;s lack of a bug bounty program. Apple didn&#x27;t have one either until quite recently either."

"I don’t know, in Germany, Spain, Italy and probably most other EU countries we have rules that forbid various types of hate speech. For instance in Italy you can be charged for spreading “fascist ideas”. Not exactly sure if US has that? That would provide an objective framework for these discussions. I do think Patreon has a brand to defend and they do what’s right for them, but then they should be much more clear and upfront about it. I don’t think banning individuals is ok, I think updating your policies, communicating them clearly and then banning those violating them with upfront anticipation would be the correct way here.<p>Also, looking from outside, challenging various ideas in US today seems to be tabu. For instance, nobody dares to even slightly criticize the current feminist movement&#x2F;s. I don’t know, no movement I have studied in human history has been 100% right. But again, if Patreon does not want anybody to criticize feminism they can be upfront about it, put it clearly in their policies and that would be ok, they own their platform after all."

They can suspend any of your listings and give zero reasons.  They will hold on to your money and keep it hostage.<p>All I have to do as a competitor to royally fuck you up is have a few people buy your product&#x2F;s and then contact Amazon to complain that they are counterfeit or somehow not as represented by the listing.  Boom! Listing shutdown, account suspended or both.  If you call Seller Support for help the story you are likely to get is the the &quot;Seller Performance team does not share the reasons for which they take certain measures&quot;.  Boom! Again.  You just got shafted, have no clue why and have no recourse.  All you can do is wait and see what the internal Amazon process might decide.<p>I have a friend who was in a similar predicament.  He was forced to have all of his inventory destroyed because it would have cost so much in shipping to recover it from Amazon warehouses that telling Amazon to destroy it was a better option."

"A space elevator only provides access to geostationary orbit.  One can climb up to LEO altitudes along an elevator, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much.  You wouldn&#x27;t be in orbit, but sitting stationary as if atop a tall building.  So we would still need to launch rockets for any space use in LEO (GPS and imaging sats for example).  And any such orbiting objects would of course have to be navigated around this obstruction.  Many useful orbit types would have to be outlawed to protect the elevator.<p>I wonder, is easier to launch into a LEO from the ground or from a fixed point at say 300km altitude?  If you climbed a space elevator you would still need 8km&#x2F;s of speed laterally.  So you jump off and fire your rocket.  You still fall towards the ground, requiring some thrust to keep out of the atmosphere.  Without the arcing trajectory of a ground launch you would have to accelerate roughly twice as quickly, requiring larger engines.  Is that really any better than starting from the ground as we do today?<p>Or you could climb to a near-geostationary position, burn retrograde until you touch the atmosphere, then aerobrake down to LEO.  That&#x27;s still a heck of a lot of effort."
"&gt; For example, you sell a business to someone who pays you a big premium for your goodwill value usually tied to the value of the customer base. It is entirely fair that, having taken the money in exchange for the sale of your goodwill interest, you not be able to turn around the day after the close and effectively steal it back from your buyer by setting up a competing business and conducting raids to get back your old customers. A reasonable restriction on your ability to compete in that case makes eminent sense and is not in any way unfair.<p>During the sale the customer information and contacts can be (and by default usually are IIRC) considered an asset of the company, as such the seller reusing contacts can be considered a form of corporate espionage and can be prosecuted in that manner.<p>This holds just as clearly for departing employees, making unauthorized use of a company&#x27;s assets after leaving a company is illegal whether it&#x27;s sneaking in and using your old office or continuing to use contacts, just because in one of those cases the data might be in your phone doesn&#x27;t change the legality.<p>But!

To make the whole exercise cost-efficient, a retreat is usually conducted for a small to medium-sized group, rather than for just one or two participants.<p>In the context of religious institutions, it is a fairly common practice to organize retreats for persons who are finalizing their preparations for a change in state of life, e.g. going from single to married, lay person to ordained, student to graduate, etc. The topics addressed at such retreats usually pertain to that change, with an aim to help participants better prepare <i>internally</i> for the obligations and challenges ahead."

"I&#x27;m not really sure the 2020 Calabasa crash is a relevant example.  That helicopter had a radio altimeter, and it surely wasn&#x27;t being jammed.  And before hitting the ground, the helicopter was descending at 20 m&#x2F;s.  The last known intent of the pilot was to climb, not descend.  Some witnesses on the ground report that the helicopter sounded like it was malfunctioning before the crash.  I do not particularly credit eye witnesses, but their story seems to fit with the rapid descent of the helicopter more than an altimeter issue."

"The post above was about the latency of random access to a file, not about the duration of a restoring operation.<p>The tapes have the fastest sequential transfer speed of any alternative, so the restoring duration should be better than from anything else, if the restoring software plans correctly the sequence of retrievals.<p>It is true that if the backup software is not clever, you could waste a lot of time to determine what you must restore and where is it. However, this has nothing to do with the tapes, the same can happen with backup on HDDs if the backup software is equally bad.<p>I am not sure what you mean by having lots of more tapes than reader, as that is the point of tape storage and the cause of it low cost per terabyte.<p>The only way that I could understand that phrase as a disadvantage for tapes is that when you would need to read as fast as possible e.g. 300 TB with one reader, that would need 10 days, but if the 300 TB were stored on 25 HDDs and you would also have 25 spare computers and some technicians that could open the computers and connect the HDDs inside them and you would also have an 100 Gb&#x2F;s Ethernet network from those computers to the destination of those 300 TB, then yes, you could read the 300 TB 12 times faster that with a single tape reader.<p>However, such circumstances seem too unbelievable. For such a huge organization it would be more realistic to buy immediately e.g. 3 more readers to reduce the reading time from 10 days to 2.5 days.<p>On the other hand, if the 25 HDDs would have been located from the beginning inside a backup system, then that system would have had a price with at least 5 digits, far higher than the cost of a tape backup system, and unless it would have been connected by 100 Gb&#x2F;s or at least 25 Gb&#x2F;s Ethernet, its speed could not have been much higher than that of a single tape drive."

"As I noted, my reason for flac&#x2F;alac is for transcoding purposes. I mainly just transcode them to mp3 currently and play them in itunes anyways, but I have the freedom to transcode to any format in the future without a degradation in quality. You can&#x27;t do that with lossy formats like mp3.<p>Double blind tests show that 320kbp&#x2F;s mp3s are indistinguishable from flacs, barring very poor masters or some extreme edge cases. For a lot of music you could get away with 256kbp&#x2F;s probably, but it doesn&#x27;t cost you anything to just go with 320kbp&#x2F;s."
"If they&#x27;re aggressive enough, I&#x27;d say there could justifiably be a quite large latency. Say for example their block size is 55 disks with 10% redundancy. Then the seek time is the maximum seek time of the lowest 50 seek times within the set of disks which haven&#x27;t failed. Now there&#x27;s a queue to read each drive, and it may very well frequently be a huge maximum  queue pretty much every time. Even if the queue is typically short, they would still have to show a typical high value, which I&#x27;d say is essentially read time of an entire disk.<p>Now factor that the disks are both large and crappy. A 120 Mb&#x2F;s read speed and 1Tb disk size would imply 8000 secs ~ 2 hours. Factor possibility of differential pricing as you mentioned (even longer queues), and you may get an upper bound of 3 or 4 hours.<p>I&#x27;m just speculating though."
"The reason the Earth doesn&#x27;t fall into the sun is that it&#x27;s moving quickly enough that the centripetal force balances the Sun&#x27;s gravity.  If you escape the Earth&#x27;s gravity well and give it a small push it would still have nearly as much orbital energy as the Earth and way more than Venus, which hadn&#x27;t fallen into the sun either.<p>To slow down enough that you could fall into the sun you need to kill 30 km&#x2F;s of velocity.  To go fast enough to escape the solar system you only need about 15 km&#x2F;s.  And crashing into Jupiter is even cheaper than that."

"Skylake-X has 44 PCI 3.0 lanes, that&#x27;s 352GT&#x2F;s or about 345gbps application bandwidth.  It&#x27;s certainly more than enough to push 100gbps from disk to net.

The 100Mbit&#x2F;s figure is useful for informing me how fast a particular YouTube video will buffer, for example, but by your proposed metric, sustained 100Mbit&#x2F;s would have to be advertised as 30TB&#x2F;month. &quot;20 Mbit&#x2F;s with a 300 GB&#x2F;month cap&quot; is more informative."

"The Parallella Gen-1 has single precision throughput of 90 GFLOPS, power draw of 5W, and unit cost of $99. This yields 0.91 FLOPS&#x2F;s per dollar and 18 FLOPS per Watt.<p>By comparison, the NVIDIA GTX 780 Ti GPU has single precision throughput of 5046 GFLOPS, maximum TDP of 250W, and unit cost of $699. This yields 7.22 FLOPS per dollar and 20 FLOPS per Watt.<p>This makes the GPU board 8 times cheaper and at least 1.1 times more power efficient than the Parallella board.<p>Note that the average cost of electrical power in the US is about 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), which means a single GPU board running 24 hours at peak utilization would cost about 63 cents per day - so it would take over 3 years of 24&#x2F;7 peak operation for the nominal power cost to equal the upfront unit cost. So while power efficiency is very important, that doesn&#x27;t mean the unit cost can be ignored.<p>In addition to FLOPS&#x2F;$ and FLOPS&#x2F;W, one must also consider the processing power density, which essentially measures how many &quot;FLOPS per cubic foot&quot; are yielded by each device. This is important because these machines take up physical space and physical space (i.e. real estate) is costly. A single GPU board has 56 times the throughput of a single Parallella board, and I would say that a GPU board is only slightly larger than the Parallella board (mainly because GPU boards include massive cooling components which Parallella lacks). A machine that requires 56 times more real estate to achieve 
the same performance is clearly not competitive.<p>So far we&#x27;ve only looked at floating-point throughput. One must also consider memory capacity and bandwidth of each device. The GTX 780 Ti has 3GB GDDR5 memory, and I understand that Parallella has 1GB memory. I don&#x27;t know how the memory bandwidth compares between the two.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the Parallella board has a long way to go before it could be competitive for supercomputing applications. And as Parallella tries to catch up, the industry will keep moving - GPUs (and other accelerators, like Xeon Phi) we continue to improve along all these dimensions and I imagine that NVIDIA&#x2F;Intel&#x2F;AMD have vastly larger R&amp;D budgets than Parallella&#x2F;Adapteva. So it is difficult to see how this could ever be a viable supercomputing platform and not just an interesting hobbyist  board."

"<i>What&#x27;s different to so-called 1-click hosters (rapidshare, mega, uploaded, ...)?</i><p>The main difference is that nearly all of these hosts specialize in a specific type of storage.

Also good.<p>There needs to be a strict speed limit on vertical speed.

"Another option is to reduce usage of gettimeofday() when possible.  It is not always free.<p>Roughly 10 years ago, when I was the driver author for one of the first full-speed 10GbE NICs, we&#x27;d get complaints from customers that were sure our NIC could not do 10Gbs, as iperf showed it was limited to 3Gb&#x2F;s or less.  I would ask them to re-try with netperf, and they&#x27;d see full bandwidth.   I eventually figured out that the complaints were coming from customers running distros without the vdso stuff, and&#x2F;or running other OSes which (at the time) didn&#x27;t support that (Mac OS, FreeBSD).  It turns out that the difference was that iperf would call gettimeofday() around every socket write to measure bandwidth.   But netperf would just issue gettimeofday calls at the start and the end of the benchmark, so iperf was effectively gettimeofday bound.   Ugh."

"&gt; I could write a program in assembly that is simply 1000000 triplets of (load, add, store) instructions, each reading from a sequentially-increasing memory location. We could think of it like a fully-unrolled addition loop. My CPU, operating at 3GHz, supposedly should complete this program in ~1ms (3 million instructions running at 3 billion instructions per second), but (spoiler alert) it doesn&#x27;t. Why?<p>I&#x27;ll bite.  Why doesn&#x27;t it?   And how long do you expect it to take?  I&#x27;ll claim that with a modern processor a simple loop in C probably beats this speed. If you want, we can test afterward to see if our respective theories are true.<p>The linked article claims that single-threaded reading speed of sequential memory (on his machine) is 11 GB&#x2F;s.   This means a 3 GHz system has a throughput of a little over 3B per cycle (11&#x2F;3).  This means that ever 3 cycles we can pull down 11B, which should be enough to comfortably finish our 1M loads in 1 ms.   With 64-bit integers, it&#x27;s getting a little tighter, but still should be possible.<p>I guess on a technicality you might be right, but not in a good way.  If you were to fully unroll the assembly, you might be able to slow things down enough such that you were running at less than 1 integer per 3 cycles.  A simple loop is going to be faster here.  Done right (fused SUB&#x2F;JNZ) the loop overhead should actually be zero.  Depending on what you are doing with the store (in place, or to another sequential array?) I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;d be able to get down to less than 2 cycles per 32-bit int with simple C, and pretty close to 1 cycle per int if you went all out with software prefetching and huge pages."

Moreover, they explicitly state that overuse will result in slower speeds.<p>So if you want X&#x2F;s, then you&#x27;ll need a stricter contract, and will have to pay a lot more than what you&#x27;re doing now. Or, the ISP can request that upstream services subsidize the bandwidth for downstream customers and that way you won&#x27;t have to pay more."

"&gt; I was unclear. I&#x27;m suggesting that carriers are in fact, throttling all bulk data, but reporting is focused on video.<p>Seems unlikely to me, but who knows ...<p>&gt; Also, to the extent that this throttling provides better availability in congested area, that&#x27;s a plus for users.<p>If you are being throttled, that&#x27;s obviously not increasing availability in any meaningful sense, so, no, it&#x27;s not. What would be a plus for users would be adding capacity. Not performing the contractually agreed service is the exact opposite of &quot;increasing availability&quot;.<p>Overall, the problem with all of this is that it borders on fraud. There would be no problem with selling low-bandwidth plans, if that is the only thing you can offer at economical prices. Or offering the user the choice to throttle certain services so as to conserve bandwidth. The problem is that carriers kinda-sorta sell a service and then don&#x27;t do what they kinda-sorta promised. And a big part of the problem is that everyone frames this as &quot;trying to help the customer by limiting abusers&quot;, or something similar, when really, the only abuser is the carrier selling a service they don&#x27;t intend to perform, because they would have to spend money to do that.<p>The important part is not whether some traffic is throttled, the important part is who makes the decision as to what gets throttled. If I buy 1 Mb&#x2F;s mobile IP access, and then the carrier throttles my connection to 1 Mb&#x2F;s, that&#x27;s my decision. If I buy &quot;LTE full-speed IP access&quot;, and then the carrier throttles my videos to 1 Mb&#x2F;s with no option to opt out, it is not."

"There is one missing piece to all this, I&#x2F;O.<p>Given they publish their apps on all platforms they could probably add this in the future as an ssd or PCIe storage tier by doing regular disk benchmarks.<p>However it seems like a major limiting factor, given that random access speeds on spinning drives or even cheap ssds can drop drastically by an order or two of magnitude (i.e. from 130MB&#x2F;s to 2MB&#x2F;s). 
 Given how they&#x27;re doing error correction in a distributed manner, having a fast storage tier would be a major advantage for them which would eliminate any problems from flash storage wearing out and fully gain the benefit of throughput, random access times and cheap new prices of nvme drives.<p>At the moment I probably can&#x27;t use this for streaming my own 4k videos to myself because an up to 300mbps network is not good enough for that, the slowest storage in it would be a bottleneck for a significant amounts of the experience of watching the streamed file.<p>And I definitely can&#x27;t use it for application storage given how important response time is to the user experience and user growth.<p>That all aside, those 2 are relatively extreme examples and there&#x27;s a lot of usage scenarios in between them.<p>I do admire how far they&#x27;ve gotten this given all the blockchain hyped products that have failed.

"For an attacker, a great way to cripple an organization that uses scrypt&#x2F;bcrypt easily is just to attack logins. If each login takes 1 second of work, then it&#x27;s easy to overwhelm any system system using a host of bots on distributed hosting systems.  Say an attacker can hit with a mere 1 req&#x2F;s from 100 hosts (very easy with aws&#x2F;digitalocean&#x2F;hetzner&#x2F;etc), then that&#x27;s 100 CPU-seconds of work just for logins.<p>Comparatively, if they hit with 100 req&#x2F;s for normal front-end data, caches can easily handle that.  So really, adding these types of login checks to any publicly available login page ends up creating an on-demand DDOS target.<p>From the password cracking side, the asymmetry comes from the fact that an organization has to have X amount of server resources to service Y number of requests, but an attacker can utilize the same X amount of server resources to service just one thing, breaking the exact password they are looking for.  This is further exaggerated by the fact that generally for an organization those X server resources also need to more than just service logins (like actually serve content or API data)."

"If you want to see the shock front move on something like a second timescale, I&#x27;m pretty sure you need to be close enough to be in real trouble.<p>Typical expansion velocity is on the order of 10 000 km&#x2F;s radially, so you get 20 kkm increase in diameter per second.

"I have a hard time understanding this would be a problem, considering the scale, i.e. how much water there is in an ocean.<p>Let&#x27;s say we take the amount of water mentioned in a link in another comment, and desalinate 54 million cubic feet of clean water per day in a single plant. That is 204 400 cubic meters per day. It is a huge amount, but we&#x27;re talking about operating this plant at depth of 1 km. 204 400 cubic meters is 0.0002 cubic kilometers. The California Current flows at around 0.25 m&#x2F;s which means that the cubic kilometer of water around the desalination plant will be completely exchanged almost once per hour, 21.6 times in a day.<p>I would say that the salt that you take from desalinated water is an entirely insignificant problem when just left in the ocean, even locally. It&#x27;s a drop in the ocean. Most likely the saltiness of water will vary a lot more due to other reasons (e.g. how much water evaporates locally).<p>Other aspects of access to more water in places like California are probably a much more relevant environmental problem. That water is mostly going to be used as irrigation water in agriculture. This will flush a huge amount of earth particles to the ocean.

"Nitrogen is also inert enough for such use, it&#x27;s easily contained and it doesn&#x27;t require such measures.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Having a pressurized enclosure might make the drive more expensive as stronger materials need to be used, and it would also make it more dangerous in case of mishandling&lt;&lt;&lt;<p>Actually containing He at all would require these measures anyway, as He diffuses through solids much faster than air and as such cannot be easily contained. To quote the wikipedia article;<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;One industrial application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than air, it is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L&#x2F;s (10−10 Pa·m3&#x2F;s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.<p>Helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.&lt;&lt;&lt;<p>Further, high pressure containers are dangerous as they might have an outward failure. That is unlikely to be the case with a drive that is at say .5 atm as the pressure is directed inwards, so the worst case over is most probably a drive filled with air or a slightly crumpled drive. (as a thought experiment think about how submarines implode instead of exploding when the hull encounters pressures beyond what it can handle)"

So a speed that&#x27;s magnitude or magnitude and a half less then current consumer SSD drives. But still a magnitude faster then spinning disk. I&#x27;m confident that would be more then enough to make most desktop environment work feel just as snappy as a SSD or within an acceptable factional difference.<p>If you could make this at $100 to $120 price point drives. That&#x27;s like 1&#x2F;2 the cost of a low end desktop 1TB SSD drive (like the Toshiba&#x2F;OCZ) You&#x27;d have a hot seller in peoples gaming rigs, mid-range laptops etc.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m missing something here.

"&gt; JVM provides a great deal more APIs for creating and handling threads and processes. Not something you would typically do directly in many webapp backends but there if you need it.<p>You might not need it <i>directly</i>, but under the hood it allows each request to run in its own thread, which eliminates the need for asynchronous callbacks that pollute any node.js code.  The absence of async callbacks not only makes the code cleaner, but also means that when you&#x27;re debugging and hit a breakpoint, you can follow the call stack all the way back to the request entrypoint.<p>&quot;Asynchronous Libraries&quot; is listed as a pro for Node, but unless you&#x27;re doing something very IO-intensive at 10K req&#x2F;sec, asynchronicity is not going to matter one bit on the JVM since it&#x27;s multithreaded.  Going from sync to async at 10K req&#x2F;s will save you a few MB of RAM, that&#x27;s all.  Assuming you&#x27;ve got that few MB to spare, it won&#x27;t change your throughput or responsiveness at all.  It&#x27;s a premature optimization that makes coding and debugging more difficult.  I&#x27;d rather state this as &quot;Needs Async Libraries&quot; as a con for Node."

I don&#x27;t remember which site it was, but not only did it work perfectly, it didn&#x27;t require the &quot;crowd sourced&quot; solution to mapping out pokemon that we were counting on. The developer&#x2F;s had somehow figured out how to just yank all pokemon locations. And on top of that the app was functional, gorgeous, even had its own URL (we were still in the &quot;all our apps are laughinggiraffe.herokuapp.com domains&quot; phase).<p>All in all, great experience. A nice fresh slap in the face to how much work we had ahead of us, and good fun had anyway."

"&gt; it ends up as a linear system of equations that is far harder to parallelize.<p>Yeah, basically this. If the fluid is compressible, you get a hyperbolic system with only &quot;local interactions&quot;, and this is fairly easy to parallelize on standard CPU clusters by using domain decomposition. People have scaled this to millions of cores, but it&#x27;s not very GPU-friendly.<p>If the fluid is incompressible, the problem is technically a differential-algebraic equation with an index-two constraint. To solve this you use a splitting method that gives you an elliptic (Poisson) equation for the pressure. This is a major headache even with the fastest interconnects we have today (we&#x27;re talking 40 Gbit&#x2F;s links), since the pressure at one point depends on the pressure at all the other points in your domain in each time step. For single-phase flow, you can use Fourier transforms to speed this up, but for two-phase flow you&#x27;re outta luck."

Same goes if you&#x27;re constantly pulled in outside work hours to do things and still put in 8hr days (and your salary isn&#x27;t factoring in those extra hours).

"&gt;The need to change passwords arose in April, when the Heartbleed vulnerability was revealed. Heartbleed makes systems vulnerable to data theft since attackers can use it to gain access to systems and then proceed to access and steal information without leaving a trace.<p>&gt;Even though our central IT systems are protected against Heartbleed, any accounts that have already been stolen still pose a security risk. Almost 20,000 members of the McGill community did change their McGill Password, but thousands more did not, and so additional actions have become necessary.<p>So, ff the people who got the passwords read this post then all they need to do is double the passwords they got with HeartBleed to gain access?<p>Perhaps they should quadruple the password? &#x2F;s"

"Good question!<p>I suppose that the experiment wants to capture the actual &#x27;information density&#x27; of the language, and hence looks at the full language. Then, they want to avoid any modification in speech rate due to the semantics of the spoken text.<p>This does not make sense for a hypothesis where the actual bit-rate of speech tends towards 39 b&#x2F;s. That is, when your text happens to convey more bits, you slow down.<p>However, for an alternative hypothesis, this design does make sense. The idea here is that a language naturally converges to a speech-rate that gives 39 b&#x2F;s. The idea here is that the actual speech-rate is much more constant, and just drops until it becomes too fast. For that, I&#x27;d argue you don&#x27;t want the mean bit-rate but something like the 90th percentile bit-rate. Because it seems to me that speech-rate that is &#x27;too fast&#x27; more than 10% of the time would not really be natural."

Scaling it and getting it into production is often the truly hard part--because technology, because business, because politics. And it&#x27;s possible that the state of the art in wireless will trail the state of the art in fiber optics for quite some time.<p>I agree with your other points, though. People lack imagination about the potential of high-speed access. Although, that potential will be hard to realize unless and until those speeds become pervasive.

"There are advantages and disadvantages.  Closeness is a big issue, I&#x27;ll grant you that.  Robots on the Moon&#x27;s surface can get quick guidance form humans on Earth much more quickly than robots on Mars.  And if something goes wrong you can get home more quickly.<p>The gravity well difference is a thing but isn&#x27;t straightforward.  You need twice as much delta-v to take off from Mars as from the Moon (3800 m&#x2F;s versus 1730 m&#x2F;s).  But on the other hand Mars has an atmosphere and while it isn&#x27;t think enough for you to touch down gently with a big mass you&#x27;ll only need 200 m&#x2F;s or so to cushion your landing.  But you need heat shields on Mars, but you need those to get back to Earth too.  But lack of atmosphere means you could maybe use a mass driver to help take off from the Moon.<p>Mars has a gravity that&#x27;s 2&#x2F;5 of Earth&#x27;s while the Moon&#x27;s is 1&#x2F;6.  Is that important for human health?  We have no frigging clue since the budget for a centrifuge on the ISS was cut.<p>The Moon rotates once every month and Mars once every 24 hours.  If you&#x27;re using solar panels it&#x27;s a big deal making it though the lunar night, you&#x27;ll need <i>lots</i> of batteries, maybe 25 times the weight of your panels.  On Mars you need maybe the weight of your panels in batteries.  There are the Peaks of Eternal Light on the south pole of the moon where this isn&#x27;t an issue and you can just keep pointing your solar panels at different parts of the horizon all month.<p>And finally the martian atmosphere provides some protection against radiation and small meteors.  It&#x27;s not a super friendly environment in either case with no magnetic field so you&#x27;ll probably be spending a lot of time under ground in either location.<p>So, it&#x27;s complicated and I&#x27;m not willing to say that one is the true path and the other is stupid."

"&gt; No, it takes a lot of energy to get out of orbit<p>Does it? It takes ~10000 m&#x2F;s of delta-v to reach low Earth orbit, but afaik only about extra ~30 m&#x2F;s to deorbit, with aerobraking taking care of the rest of the velocity. Or is there any extra intricacy in the details?"

"Tried a Palette 2s for a few weeks before returning it - even wrote my own Duet 3 plugin for the feedback loop. Tried it with several different printers including a custom built one, and tried it using a variety of extruders and hotheads. Not worth the time or money.<p>Their support is completely unhelpful (I ended up reverse engineering the octoprint python plugin) and while its pretty piece of hardware, it is largely a very expensive paper weight as another commenter mentioned. Several design flaws make it very frustrating to find the right settings for material combinations since it clogs all the time, forget doing true multimaterial (not just multicolor) printing unless you make a binding layer (TPU) or chose compatible plastics since most stick together worse than PET, and the closed loop feedback mechanism is far from good enough to have even 50% success rate. I managed to get a few decent prints from the contraption but it required babying the 3d printer even more than before. If you have wild humidity or temperature swings (such as when doing a long 10-20 hour print), you can forget about any sort of reliability. Oh and it is <i>slow</i> - best I&#x27;ve gotten on the 2S is 40mm&#x2F;s (one of the printers I tried it on maxes out at 200-300 mm&#x2F;s, though few materials can support that speed).<p>That said, without that closed loop feedback, the method described in the paper simply will not work on nontrivial prints. If I&#x27;m understanding it correctly, it&#x27;s just doing the same thing as the Palette except not in real time."

"GC of 500 request&#x2F;s could not have possibly caused a performance issue.  Most likely the problem was due to JS code holding on to the 1MB requests for the duration of the asynchronous Kinesis request or a bug in the Kinesis JS library itself.  With timeout of 2 minutes, you may end up with up to 30K&#x2F;min x 2min x 1mb = 60GB RAM used. GC would appear running hot during this time but it is only because it is has to scrape more memory somewhere while up to 60gb is being in use."
"IP transit in data centers etc is often a combination of a base rate + extra fees based on the 95% percentile (if that value is over the base rate).

Whereas if you use the link fully for 2 % of the time, but then stay under the base rate the rest of  month, you only pay the base price."

The thing is at this point a lot of latency comes from the fact that each dimm is physically displaced from the cpu.<p>When you are on a timescale of nanoseconds even electricity&#x27;s speed can be slow when being compared to something like intel&#x27;s l4 cache which is on-die.<p>For any type of volatile memory that latency will exist until mobo designers move the ram closer to the cpu or adopt optical interfaces between parts.<p>For some cool calculations that can put things in perspective take the speed of light as 299 792 458 m&#x2F;s and take the time of a nanosecond as 10^-9 seconds to get ~0.3 m&#x2F;ns for light. That means that for every third of a meter the dimms are away from the cpu means a constant 1ns delay in terms of latency.

"Grasshopper can hover for a while because, at least at that stage in its flight, it is heavier than the returning F9 core.  As it burns more and more fuel it becomes lighter and lighter, and I believe that towards the end of Grasshopper flights it is too light to hover.<p>The landing that Grasshopper has been doing recently, and which the F9 core will do, has been termed a &quot;hover-slam&quot; by SpaceX.  Basically it decelerates rapidly, hitting 0m&#x2F;s <i>right</i> when it also hits the ground.

"&gt;That&#x27;s not how impulse propagates. The force carries through the plate, into the person, and does its damage as a compressive wave.<p>That would be true if the plate was pressed hard against the body. A force requires a carrier - a field or a matter. This is why there is padding behind armor. The padding air-gaps the body from the plate. Nothing crosses the air gap during the 0.02ms that the huge force you&#x27;re talking about is acting between the plate and the bullet. The body isn&#x27;t aware that something that violent is happening just a few millimeters away. At t=0.02ms the interaction between the bullet and the plate has finished and the plate is flying toward the body with the speed  ~16m&#x2F;s. At that t=0.02ms the plate has so far traveled only for less than 1mm and it will take it ~0.5 milisecond to cross the air gap and to slam into the body at about the same speed of 16m&#x2F;s. Such slamming is like being hit by a frying pan. Can be pretty damaging if hits a joint or the head. May break a rib. Yet nothing close to being subjected to the force of being stepped on by an elephant or 30 of them.<p>&gt;Why then does a shotgun slug, with considerably less momentum than the .50 cal and even a frying pan, crack ribs through armor?<p>The slug momentum (0.03kg at 540m&#x2F;s) is 2.5 times less than that of .50 cal (0.045kg at 900m&#x2F;s), so nothing surprising here, especially if it is through a flexible (i.e. different mode of action) kevlar armor. The steel plate armor we&#x27;re discussing is much heavier.<p>&gt;Why can I put a piece of AR500 steel in front of a watermellow, hit the steel with a .308, and have the watermellon explode despite nothing getting through?<p>Even if the watermelon is air-gapped from the steel, the watermelon still can&#x27;t sustain being hit with a frying pan ( even with less than a full swing of it). If the steel isn&#x27;t air-gapped from the watermellon - in this case the watermelon do get the force applied if the steel isn&#x27;t fixed, or a compression wave by the steel plate vibration if the steel is fixed in place."

"Speedtest is a more accurate measure of what you&#x27;re actually paying for - which is a connection to the ATT network. The speedtest server is right on their network most likely.<p>Fast.com is a more functional test, specifically measuring how fast a connection on the ATT network in that area to the Netflix servers is. You&#x27;re not paying ATT for a 24mb&#x2F;s connection to every server on the entire internet because that would be impossible (how could your ISP promise you that much bandwidth across a transatlantic cable, or over a satellite link, or to a server connected via dialup). More generally, you&#x27;re testing the strength of their peering and the route available for a specific purpose (watching Netflix).<p>They aren&#x27;t measuring the same thing at all. It would be like buying a 100mb&#x2F;s router, plugging it into 20mb&#x2F;s internet and then complaining that your router is broken because you can&#x27;t download at 100mb&#x2F;s. Your router will still show your ability to contact other computers in your house as 100mb&#x2F;s (analogous to speedtest), but reaching computers outside your network (analogous to fast) is limited by the speed of your connection to the next larger network."

"&gt; I can see that the majority of consumer and business workflows only involve running one or two applications at a time, but the extra cores and hardware threads can make a difference if you need to run multiple applications simultaneously.<p><i>If</i> you need to run multiple applications simultaneously <i>and</i> they do sufficient amount of computations to generate noticeable load.<p>&gt; Office applications may be single-threaded, but if you need to open Word, Excel, and Powerpoint simultaneously they can each use a separate core.<p>And idle. Unless you&#x27;re actively editing a document, the applications are doing exactly nothing with their separate cores. And so far, our attempts to create four-armed employees able to write two concepts at the same time have hit some unexpected difficulties, so generally only one document is doing any CPU intensive work (and promptly hits 100% load for the single core it can use).<p>Excel would be an exception, if we did any heavy processing in it – which we don&#x27;t.

Windows Explorer is singlethreaded (or has very unfortunate locking), so a single stalling I&#x2F;O request (spinning up disk&#x2F;CD drive; SMB over WAN) hangs up the device&#x27;s entire UI. Windows Update is singlethreaded, resulting in hour-long churn while computing applicable updates. And so on.

"I think the emphasis on unified memory is a bit of a red herring here.  In my experience, heterogeneous computing means optimizing data placement such that the parallel-friendly number crunching is done entirely on the GPU and I&#x2F;O, process control, and telemetry are orchestrated by the CPU.<p>Failure to consider data placement destroys much of the potential perf gain for getting the above right IMO. And  unified memory won&#x27;t make this any better if BW within a GPU is ~1 GB&#x2F;s and system bandwidth is ~10x less.  It will just sweep the problem under the rug.<p>Further, I have seen attempts to smear parallel computations system-wide, treating all the ALUs as equivalent, but this frequently breaks determinism when the compilers for the two different processor architectures create associatively different implementations of the same computation.  And I see no resolution to that problem right now.<p>That said, GPUs have advanced enormously in the past decade.  Branching is nowhere near the big deal it once was, the cache (L1 and register file) for a GPU core (an SMX not NVIDIA&#x27;s silly redefinition of a SIMD lane) is surprisingly large, and insanely fast atomic ops can resolve a lot of potential concurrency issues (even deterministically if one prudently employs fixed-point math)."

"&gt;lets say we stop the bullet over the distance of 1cm instead of 2 inches - the stopping force to act upon bullet would be even bigger - 1.8M Newtons (30 elephants!). The same value force will be acting upon our 5lb armor plate. This force will be acting until the bullet stops, ie. for about 0.02 milliseconds. During that time the force would accelerate the armor plate to the speed of 16m&#x2F;s and the armor plate would travel less than 1mm - only starting to compress the padding under the armor plate. So, 0.02 milliseconds after the bullet impact we have a stopped bullet and the armor plate moving with the speed of 16m&#x2F;s through the first millimeter of the padding - the situation is no different than being hit by a frying pan.<p>That&#x27;s not how impulse propagates. The force carries through the plate, into the person, and does its damage as a compressive wave. Think about seatbelts in a car during a high speed crash - they don&#x27;t often penetrate the torso of people, but they can and do pop organs through compressive effects if they&#x27;re worn too high. Yet calculate the momentum of the seat belt at 100 mph and you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s tiny, like a light slap.<p>But let&#x27;s assume your analysis is true. Why then does a shotgun slug, with considerably less momentum than the .50 cal and even a frying pan, crack ribs through armor? Why can I put a piece of AR500 steel in front of a watermellow, hit the steel with a .308, and have the watermellon explode despite nothing getting through?<p>But I&#x27;m done.

Driving faster, like Uber did here, is basically driving blind, reckless and negligent.

"Threadripper uses quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory. That gets you 80 GB&#x2F;s memory bandwidth, which is possible because the processor sits in an enormous 4094-pin TR4 socket.

"It&#x27;s also due to the fact that there&#x27;s only a few GHz of spectrum in which cheap equipment can broadcast a powerful enough signal to go any useful distance. WiFi operating in 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz are tricky but not impossible to use for anything longer-range than a single building. Much higher frequency, and you have to use pretty powerful transmitters and well-aimed highly directional antennas. Current tech allows for a few bits&#x2F;s&#x2F;Hz, so there&#x27;s only a few gbit&#x2F;s of bandwidth to be allocated between all long-range communication uses. If you want to offer gigabit speeds to households over wireless, you have to deploy a mesh network that&#x27;s so dense it would be cheaper to just lay fiber."

"Yes. But the way the system in the UK works is the worst of both worlds. Openreach is a private company (a subsidiary of BT I believe), which has been granted a monopoly and as a result has to be constantly audited by the government at great expense to ensure that they are not making too much profit or favouring some ISP&#x27;s over others. As a result, the way they make a profit for their shareholders is by being as tight as possible about everything that has no regulated minimum requirement.<p>For example, the broadband service in my town suffers from random slowdowns where everyone&#x27;s speed drops from 8mb&#x2F;s down to 0.1mb&#x2F;s for days at a time. As a town we have been complaining about it for years but nothing ever happens as we have no power over Openreach because they are a private company and are not answerable to us and they also have a de facto monopoly on the infrastructure so we can&#x27;t take our business elsewhere.<p>At least if broadband was provided by the local council, we could complain to our local councillor when it&#x27;s not working. This system works fine for other infrastructure, e.g. if the council haven&#x27;t gritted the roads we phone our councillor and she gets on to the right department, gives them a row and they sort it out.<p>As it is, most broadband infrastructure improvement projects in the UK are government driven any way. I don&#x27;t see the point of Openreach existing as a private company, seems like extra unnecessary bureaucracy which exists purely for the dogmatic reason that private companies are supposedly always more efficient, a claim which I have never seen any serious peer reviewed research to support.<p>If anyone can explain why this is not a stupid system, then I&#x27;m all ears."
"This smacks of a complete misunderstanding of SaaS and FLOSS. How did this person even get into software development?

"Hold on, buddy.<p>&gt; You can barely use a single 5Ghz router to serve a 70m^2 home at acceptable performance.<p>Of course you can&#x27;t. Compared to 2.4GHz, 5GHz barely passes through walls, and it is actually a good thing. My rule of thumb for 5GHz is to have access point every other room and to lower transmit power so that they don&#x27;t in the way of each other.<p>In effect, there are 3 APs in my 160m^2, two storey flat. I get easily minimum 400-500MBit&#x2F;s on AC with multiple users in any spot in the flat but I don&#x27;t use typical consumer hardware. To do 5GHz properly in a large home you need something that will be able to properly roam users while they are moving about.<p>Where I live I see about 250-260 2.4GHz access points at any point in time and 2.4GHz is almost useless. I only see 3 5GHz APs. The fact that 5GHz is so attenuated by the walls makes it usable in high density environment.<p>I have also found that one shiny laptop that was more pricey than others had trouble with lower speeds and constant disconnets. <i>LOWERING</i> transmit power actually helped, because it caused it to be kicked earlier from AP and switch to another, closer one.<p>So, to underline, you need to know technology you are using.

"Bear in mind that exchanges are owned by the companies that trade on them - they&#x27;ve got a VERY strong vested interest in not fixing the problem.<p>HFT works because fast traders can see a buy and sell order that are a distance apart, buy from the seller, then immediately offer to sell it at a fractionally higher price. Because they can see the buy order at all times, they know they can sell what they&#x27;ve just bought and make a tiny profit. All they have to do is ensure they can see the buy and sell orders faster than anyone else, then keep hitting those orders. Repeat until retirement.<p>Several years ago, a new exchange was set up to try to address this problem by simply putting a huge coil (many km) of fibre in front of the system&#x2F;s that accepted orders. This approach meant that, while HFTs could still see orders before anyone else and hit them faster, their speed advantage was largely lost due to the latency as their order placement was just a bit slower. As a result there was no guarantee the 2nd part of the order those HFTs were hitting was still there, so they might get left holding a position without being able to sell it at the profit they were used to. Each HFT could try to front run orders as they do now, but the fairly small increase in latency killed their advantage.<p>HFT companies managed to avoid using this exchange very successfully."

It could capture a lot more of the value chain and lower friction-to-purchase for indie musicians. Perhaps the reason was to not be competitive with its initiatives to get record labels (who likely prefer to drive sales through existing platforms for quixotic reasons) on board for SoundCloud Go.

"These big switch boxes typically end up being about thermal management and this box looks like thermal design was an afterthought.

Generally speaking if you&#x27;re in the market for a 640Gb&#x2F;s switch (or 3.8Tb&#x2F;s switch), does your data center really not have access to 48V power?  The AC&#x2F;DC conversion wastes power and space.<p>The QSFP&#x27;s are &quot;spaced for optimal airflow.&quot;  However this spacing seems to neglect cooling the QSFPs themselves.  Belly-to-belly mounting of modules is usually the most thermally challenging way to arrange them.  The heat dissipated by the QSFP&#x27;s is generally directed towards the top of the module.  By placing open air channels between modules, they have effectively ensured that little to no air flows over the QSFP heat sinks (which is not shown).  So there is probably a limitation on which reach codes are supported.  My guess is that because of the thermal limitations of this design, it&#x27;s not truly non-blocking in all reach configurations."

What is the problem?<p>Go google &#x27;syncing ethereum&#x27; you will get all kinds of advice to delete all your files, and run --fast, which is just the chain and not the blocks, ... but ok, you still don&#x27;t sync for real,<p>Then there is the C++ issue, ETH has discontinued C++ and gone with &#x27;GO&#x27;, ok, but here&#x27;e the real deal killer.<p>ETHEREUM say&#x27;s &#x27;cryptography by obscurity&#x27;, thus they don&#x27;t document anything and deny everything and nobody knows what&#x27;s going on, now some people would call this &#x27;incompetence&#x27; in another lifetime ( I was writing c++ compilers in early 1980&#x27;s )<p>The problem with both BTC &amp; ETH is the hype because of the wealth &#x27;effect&#x27; makes everyone blind to the problems, ... which just means one thing to an &#x27;old timer&#x27; this is great time for other&#x27;s to jump ahead and resolve the problems.<p>Here&#x27;s another deal about ETH, BUTERIN at 14 won a coding COMP, hell were we all not child prodigy&#x27;s??

IMHO BUTERIN has no base, and is largely self taught, so who cares what he thinks or does ( topic of this article )<p>But to the real issue is that ETH has TERRIBLE problems, and the biggest problem is that the CORE (BUTERIN) doesn&#x27;t trust and hates its users ( the &#x27;obscurity is safety principal&#x27; ) again, the idea is if they don&#x27;t  tell the truth no bad people can harm them, but the problem of course is because they don&#x27;t tell the truth they surround themselves with liars, &quot;YES MEN&quot;.<p>ETH is a basked case of problems, and of course BTC is not far behind,<p>BITCOIN 2.0 will jump to 3.0 and leave all this crap behind,<p>Jump forward men, all you fear to lose is your chains."

"The further from the sun you get the less acceleration you get from the sun.

However, that sail would be quickly destroyed by the sun and other things.

"I just can&#x27;t seem to figure out where you are coming from on this.  My first question is, why would you plug a device with transfer rates in the 20-40GB&#x2F;s range into a SATA3(6Gpbs) port?  
Next is although we can wax poetically on what exactly is the best case for every ones use cases how are you going to guarantee that the micro controller will work the way you want it to?
Databases with properly configured indexes will retain the important data in RAM with out further modifications, and again how would you ensure that the records you feel should be cached are cached since the small micro controller would barely have the resources to analyze the data stream to begin with.<p>Lastly if you do care about data retention during power outages and sags then you would likely want an APC&#x2F;backup battery.  Even though the data stored in the SSD&#x2F;RAM hybrid might have enough backup power to flush to disk how about the data that is currently in RAM waiting to be flushed as well?"
"Well, it&#x27;s also very high.

"Even if you have a super-fast interconnect, you can only fill as fast as something else can send it, right?<p>I mean, if it&#x27;s in CPU memory than you are limited to whatever the CPU memory can deliver.  Which is 40 GB&#x2F;s per socket from quad-channel DDR4, more or less.  You can probably double that with compression, but it&#x27;s still vastly less than you&#x27;d get from VRAM.<p>And you get the same speedups from <i>storing the data compressed in VRAM</i> assuming you have some fast method for indexing into the stream, or you&#x27;re searching the whole stream.  But yes, assuming your data can be dehydrated and then stored in CPU memory you can squeeze a little more bandwidth out of it this way.<p>If it&#x27;s GPU memory (in another GPU across NVLink&#x2F;GPUDirect&#x2F;etc), then you should be doing the searching on that GPU instead.<p>The stipulation here has always been &quot;tasks that don&#x27;t fit into GPU memory aren&#x27;t going to work&quot; so if you are assuming that the data lives on another GPU... then you are violating the pre-condition of all of this discussion, because it fits into GPU memory.<p>Yes, if your data fits into GPU memory it&#x27;s very fast, because VRAM bandwidth is enormous.  The catch is always getting it to fit into GPU memory.  That&#x27;s why you need a &quot;tiered&quot; system - indexes or important columns live on the GPU, then you return them to the CPU where you do additional processing with them.  It&#x27;s like L1&#x2F;L2&#x2F;L3&#x2F;memory hierarchy on a CPU - sure, your program that fits into cache is super fast, but many real-world tasks don&#x27;t fit into cache.<p>If your entire dataset is small enough that it fits in VRAM on one box&#x27;s worth of GPUs (4-8 per box), or within a few racks or whatever... that&#x27;s great, go hog wild.  But it&#x27;s not very cost effective versus a tiered approach, this is like asking for a CPU with 16 GB of cache (or enough CPUs to add up to 16 GB of cache).  It&#x27;s outright impossible for very large datasets (96-192 GB is not a very large dataset in this context, but it&#x27;s a reasonable amount of <i>index space</i> for a 1.5 TB or 3 TB dataset on the CPU socket).<p>Once you start having to transfer stuff into and out of VRAM, GPU performance typically starts to rapidly degrade.  It&#x27;s &quot;only a second or two&quot; to you... but that&#x27;s a terabyte&#x27;s worth of VRAM bandwidth that sat idle for that time.  &quot;Rolling&quot; approaches like this do not work very well on GPUs.  You want to avoid transferring stuff on or off as much as possible because you just can&#x27;t do it fast enough.<p>Computational intensity is one way to avoid doing that, both in VRAM and to host memory.  If you can transfer a byte (per core) every P cycles, and you perform at least P cycles&#x27; worth of computation on it... you&#x27;re compute bound.  And at that point you can probably make a &quot;rolling&quot; algorithm work.  But the problem is doing that (without just being obviously wasteful).  In practice, P is like 1 byte every 72 cycles or something (working from memory here).  It&#x27;s really hard to find that much work to do on a byte in many cases.  So despite their massive compute power... GPUs are often I&#x2F;O bound on most tasks.  Crypto tasks (hashing) are a notable exception.<p>Note that I&#x2F;O bound here can happen <i>in different areas</i> too.  You can be I&#x2F;O bound over the GPU bus, or on the VRAM.  It depends on where the piece of data you need lives.<p>Also, in gaming it&#x27;s typically <i>the CPU</i> which is bound in draw-calls.  The CPU can&#x27;t assemble the command lists fast enough to saturate the GPU (at least not on a single thread).  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s <i>necessarily</i> I&#x2F;O bound in this case, either, but it&#x27;s possible.<p>Normally GPUs will only use a fraction of their VRAM bandwidth while gaming - however, like anything else, throwing superfluous resources at it <i>will</i> still produce a speedup even if it&#x27;s not really &quot;the KEY bottleneck&quot;.  Having memory calls return in fewer cycles will let your GPU get its shaders back to work quicker, even though it means the memory may be idle for a greater percent of time (i.e. utilization continues to fall).<p>Assuming you were going to do a DB where you store literally everything on the GPU - I&#x27;m not sure whether it would be better to go columnar or by row.  In a columnar approach you would have one(or more) GPUs per column, and they would either sequentially broadcast their resulting rowIDs and all perform set-intersection on their own datasets, or dump their set of output rowIDs to a single &quot;master&quot; GPU which would find the set intersection.  In a row approach, you would have each GPU find &quot;candidate&quot; row-IDs and then dump them to the CPU, and the CPU handles broadcasting and intersecting (since hopefully it&#x27;s not a large set-intersection).<p>Columnar might be faster for supported queries, but row would be simpler to implement and more flexible (since the critical data processing would more or be taking place on the CPU).<p>I would have to play with it to be sure, and I don&#x27;t have access to a cluster of GPUs anymore (and never had access to one with NVLink or GPUDirect)."

The document I cited gives specific numbers of authorized v&#x2F;s unauthorized immigrants giving an idea of the scales we&#x27;re talking about.<p>Its pretty clear that you&#x27;ve made up your mind about what the state of the world is (from various anecdata) and don&#x27;t really care what the statistics really say. I will leave this as my last comment about this issue.

"I&#x27;m using real engines and fuel consumption (draco thrusters from Space-X) and somewhat realistic ship mass (3t) and I can tell you space combat is virtually impossible. Especialy &quot;space pirates&quot; kind of fight where they wait in ambush mid way. I fly mostly around jupiter and &quot;eyeballing it&quot; from one moon to another is impossible. You can fly reasonably easy within few km from space station but that&#x27;s it. For everything else expect delta V more than km&#x2F;s. Guided missiles would imho be impossible with FPS realistically achievable in game. Dunno about lasers, i&#x27;m trying to keep it real."

"Speed is distance &#x2F; time, acceleration and deceleration is distance &#x2F; time ^2.  If you accelerate at say 9.8 m&#x2F;s^2 for 1 second that&#x27;s 9.8 m&#x2F;s&#x2F;s * 1s = 9.8m&#x2F;s aka if you fall for 1 second your going 22 miles per hour and still being pulled down at 9.8m&#x2F;s&#x2F;s.<p>Using a star a solar sail can change it&#x27;s speed by ~60km&#x2F;sec by accelerating much much slower than that for months.  The problem is the further from a star get the lower your acceleration.  To maximize final speed you basically want to get as close to the star as you can in a huge elliptical orbit and then on your final pass just keep accelerating.  Or do the reverse on the way back.<p>Is that clear?"

"An interesting thought I&#x27;d never read about though I thought the speed of gravity waves was further constrained to 2.993 × 10^8 and 3.003 × 10^8, but any difference is sufficient.<p>The part I don&#x27;t follow is that light follows the curvature of space-time and it&#x27;s the distortion of space-time that propagates at the speed of gravity. Even if this distortion propagated at 10 m&#x2F;s the path of light and the path of gravitational attraction would be along the same lines of acceleration."
"Nope, that&#x27;s not an improvement. You gotta add hover animations to each news item, fading effects, real time updates of timestamps and likes, thumbnails(because how else can we differentiate between the items?!!1!), and don&#x27;t forget the ads inbetween to not blow a hole into your budget due to the increase in bandwidth thanks to the innovative responsive frameworks.<p>This half-assed proposal is not a good solution! &#x2F;s"

"Oneweb&#x27;s sat&#x27;s supposedly have incredible bandwidth if you beleive the CNN&#x2F;CEO hype. &quot;Steckel said they have performed better than expected, &#x27;demonstrating speeds that could rival 5G internet&#x27;.&quot;<p>They also have made a number of claims about being the leader in the effort etc (they launched six sat&#x27;s a year ago.) Not sure I fully buy their hype.<p>SpaceX has launched 360 sat&#x27;s and is explicit that speed may NOT be high bandwidth (but may be low latency) which seems a more credible baseline given the theory (one sat covers a reasonable area).<p>I personally would love 4mbp&#x2F;s ultra low latency to my parents across the country for video calls."
"Once you&#x27;re in orbit (say around the sun), you have to cancel the orbital velocity to fall into the object you&#x27;re orbiting around. If you point at the sun and accelerate 1 km&#x2F;s directly at it, you&#x27;re still moving 30 km&#x2F;s &quot;sideways&quot;. All you&#x27;d end up doing is making the orbit more elliptical-shaped.<p>At least that&#x27;s how I see it, but I am far from being an authority on this topic."
"I think the worst we have is Kabel Deutschland, they say in their ToS they&#x27;ll slow filesharing services down to 100kbit&#x2F;s for the day if you reach 10GB on that day with any kind of traffic. But as far as I know that limit is not enforced."

"Let&#x27;s see. The webm video of the car door shot is 30 fps, with each frame repeated 4 times. This suggests that original was shot at 30 fps and then reduced to 1&#x2F;4 speed.<p>The delay between the first flash from the gun and the entry hole appearing is 4 frames at original fps. At 30 fps, that gives flight time between 100 and 130 ms.<p>I estimate that the distance from the gun to the car door is around 10 m. That gives speeds on the order of 100 m&#x2F;s (200 mph).<p>Energy depends on the mass of the projectile. At these speeds, 27000 joules would require mass in the range of kilograms, which is obviously not true. Still, it seems feasible to me that this gets better than highway speeds."

"The F-22 avionics are mostly Ada. F-35 is mostly C++ though. If you want a good face-palm go read up on the &quot;decision-makers&quot; advocating making the switch.

"You say 4 Gb&#x2F;s here but in the thread below show 4GB&#x2F;s, i.e. 8-10x faster depending on how you think about link speeds.<p>What happens when you test each drive individually?  Do they all perform identically or is the 6th device slower? An array will be limited by its slowest member even if there is no bus contention.<p>Also, there are many tunable parameters and I am not sure the defaults are equivalent for RAID5 or RAID6 in the Linux-MD layer. What happens if you use all 6 drives in a RAID5 array?  What happens if you use 5 drives in a RAID6 array? Did you try changing the chunk size to match the SSD page size?  Are you sure the partitions are all aligned properly to avoid any fragmentation during SSD writes?  There are countless variables here..."

"Always on scrubbing has a number of factors depending on the provider you use. All charge for clean traffic but some charge for number of netblocks&#x2F;ASNs, number of routers, number of attacks mitigated, etc. It can get extremely expensive depending on your traffic needs and all the other variables. Paying an extra $250,000+ year for 2 Gb&#x2F;s of traffic is extremely expensive to me."

A great demonstration of why in-distribution learning is not enough for AGI.<p>The largest GPT-3 model &quot;GPT-3 175B&quot; is trained with 499 Billion tokens (one token is maybe equal to 4 characters in text).<p>Human reading&#x2F;talking&#x2F;listening equivalent of 200 pages of text per day for 80 years would be just 13GB of raw data or 3B tokens. You could also make an estimate using 39 bits&#x2F;s as the normal information rate humans can absorb and get the same order of magnitude estimate.<p>It&#x27;s not completely wrong to say that we are figuring out how  far interpolation from data can go as a learning method. Even the most advanced deep learning is in-distribution learning and system 1 thinking (Kahneman&#x27;s term). Just run through data until the model can interpolate accurately between data points.<p>We must figure out how do learn models that allow out-of-distribution learning or these models fail the Turing test after a few questions.

"On the flip side, in the early 2000s Bellsouth (now AT&amp;T) deployed FTTP in much of the Southeast and would convert that to ADSL to plug into existing house POTS wiring.  It was sold as ADSL at 12mb&#x2F;s. There was literally no other internet option available from them at the time either."
"&gt;&gt; Admittedly, Android does it much better by providing oAuth, an easy way to get the users sign in, and of course APIs for almost all the popular features.<p>First of all this has nothing to do with iOS&#x2F;Android.

Apple needs to provide oath or similar for accessing their iCloud services.<p>&gt;&gt; And also, for installing $0 apps you don&#x27;t need any credit card details at all.

"Jitter is one of the words you&#x27;re looking for. 20 milliseconds does not sound like much, but when it&#x27;s a delay in some (but not all) packets in a call getting to you, you can sure hear it!<p>Jitter is why you could have a 1 GB&#x2F;s connection at home, and still have the same occurrence of poor call quality.<p>QoS (Quality of Service) can help, but only if it is applied at every router the traffic for a call goes through.

"This was a big issue for me too. Google Compute Engine seems to have no throttling like AWS does, or at least it&#x27;s a much higher cap.

The only high bandwidth AWS instances I&#x27;ve found are the few expensive ones that spec 10 Gbit."
"As mentioned in the other discussion, I totally agree this kind of model seems to work better.<p>As an example, here in Italy we have a separate company ran by a utility provider (which is used to handle infrastructure at a scale and can leverage existing assets) taking care of deploying fiber in the cities and then they make it available to multiple ISPs (bitstream).<p>In this way you have an entity who is solely focused on building and managing the infrastructure, which is able to make investments that single ISPs would not be able to do (while trying to still be profitable).<p>The end result for the consumers is that here in Milan, as an example, multiple operators started offering 1 Gb&#x2F;s FTTH connections for around 30 EUR&#x2F;month.<p>Such fees are only possible if you do not have to try to be profitable while having to absorb the hit from deploying your own infrastructure."

"I have to say he’s wrong when he says there’s no reason for EVER using O_DIRECT.<p>One HUGE reason is performance for large sequential writes when using fast media and slow processors. Specifically, when the write speed of the media is in the same ballpark as the effective memcpy() speed of the processor itself, which, believe it or not, is very possible today (but was probably more unlikely in 2007) when working with embedded systems and modern NVMe media.<p>Consider a system with an SoC like the NXP T2080 that has a high speed internal memory bus, DDR3, and PCIe 3.0 support. The processor cores themselves are relatively slow PowerPC cores, but the chip has a ton of memory bandwidth.<p>Now assume you had a contiguous 512 MiB chunk of data to write to an NVMe drive capable of a sustained write rate of 2000 MB&#x2F;s.<p>The processor core itself can barely move 2000 MB&#x2F;s of data, so it’s clear why direct IO would perform better since you’re telling the drive to pull the data directly from the buffer instead of memcpy-ing into into an intermediate kernel buffer first. With direct IO, you can perform zero-copy writes to the media.<p>This is why I’m able to achieve higher sequential write performance on some modern MVMe drives than most benchmark sites report, all while using a 1.2 GHz PowerPC system."
"I believe GP was referring to delta as in mathematics, which refers to difference and not necessarily change. So the delta between +7km&#x2F;s and -7km&#x2F;s is 14km&#x2F;s.<p>You are technically correct, though based on common usage patio11 got their point across."
"&gt; But its not concurrently accessed memory - unlike memory you often want filesystem operations to run asynchronously.<p>Well, but it is. Files can be opened multiple times and file descriptors can be shared between any number of processes and threads. mmap, atomics and msync also give you granular access.<p>Most people might not use it that way, but the thing is that it <i>can</i> be used that way. Just like RAM can be accessed randomly from many threads but higher-level languages limit what you&#x27;re allowed to do concurrently. It&#x27;s the same fast-but-unsafe-guts, use safe abstractions thing.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m thinking about the 95% of applications out there which want to use the filesystem to save user data to disk<p>Those 95% of the applications aren&#x27;t necessarily those doing 95% of the write IO though. Looking at the activity on my system then most of the write traffic is a) logging (including messaging) b) firefox occasioally showing 1GB&#x2F;s places.sqlite spikes (hah) c) temporary files d) docker e) p2p storage.<p>For logging O_APPEND&#x27;s atomicity promise may be good enough. I don&#x27;t think text editors need transactions either, they only need file-level atomic replace which can be handled by a single library function. Such functions should be available in more libraries, I can agree with that.<p>&gt; Why should the kernel maintain an API for this? Because the default, obvious way people use the filesystem should be correct.<p>Why the kernel and not libc? Or some other userspace lib for that matter.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d be happy for an argument that the posix filesystem is too low level to be used to directly store user data.<p>That might be a matter of perspective. open&#x2F;write&#x2F;close is perfectly fine if all you do is move 100s of RAW photos from your SD card to your file server. There&#x27;s no rewrite-in-place happening, it&#x27;s a one-time thing that at worst would leave you with one incompletely copied file if the PC crashes shortly after copying. And the SD card wasn&#x27;t a bastion of reliability anyway.
Docker layers and containers are quite discardable and I wouldn&#x27;t even mind if they had 0 durability.
git, sqlite and postgres already seem to be doing the right thing.
Whether document processing software does, I don&#x27;t know but I assume they put some effort into it with all their autosaving features. But, as mentioned above, all they really need is nicer standard libs not a new kernel API.
That doesn&#x27;t leave that many things I deem critical.
Perhaps it is a little annoying if some of the configuration text files of various GUI applications get lost in a crash but on the other hand I wouldn&#x27;t want them to fsync my preferences every time I tick a checkbox so I&#x27;d only want atomicity but not synchronous durability.<p>&gt; - Most programmers don&#x27;t even bother to use fsync. Anything which starts with &quot;you can solve the trivial problem of saving a file in this super complex way&quot; is a nonstarter and will almost never be used.<p>If people can&#x27;t even be bothered to fsync then why would they be bothered to wrap IO into a transaction? After all APIs still would have to continue to work in non-transactional mode for performance and backwards-compatibility reasons so there would be no pressure on people to use transactions.<p>Maybe this also is a documentation problem since many developers don&#x27;t seem to be aware of the non-durable-by-default behavior and different steps needed to get atomicity or durability. Man pages and standard libraries lack a high level overview of filesystem semantics. Some of it is noted in fsync() for example but not in rename()"

"As I said, in most scenarios this doesn&#x27;t matter, so I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re pointing at an average scenario as some sort of counter-argument?<p>There&#x27;s a single memory controller on the M1. The CPU, GPU, neural net engine, etc... all share that single controller (hence how &quot;unified memory&quot; is achieved). Given the theoretical maximum throughput of the M1&#x27;s memory controller is 68GB&#x2F;s, and that the CPU can hit around 68GB&#x2F;s in a memcpy, I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re expecting? If you hammer the GPU at the same time, it must by design share that single 68GB&#x2F;s pipe to the memory. There&#x27;s not a secondary dedicated pipe for it to use. So the bandwidth must necessarily be split in a multi-use scenario, there&#x27;s no other option here.<p>Think of it like a network switch. You can put 5 computers behind a gigabit switch and 99% of the time nobody will ever have an issue. At any given point you can speedtest on one of them and see a full 1gbit&#x2F;s on it. But if you speedtest on all of them simultaneously you of course won&#x27;t see each one getting 1gbit&#x2F;s since there&#x27;s only a single 1gbit&#x2F;s connection upstream. Same thing here, just with a 68GB&#x2F;s 8x16-bit channel LPDDR4X memory controller.<p>The only way you can get full-throughput CPU &amp; GPU memory performance is if you physically dedicated memory modules to the CPU &amp; GPU independently (such as with a typical desktop PC using discrete graphics). Otherwise they must compete for the shared resource by definition of being shared."

"&gt; You&#x27;re making the mistake of assuming that because occasionally new products are dismissed incorrectly<p>Well your mistake is that my assumption is less correct than yours.

Having to carry a laptop everywhere is a real pain point which increases depending on where you live.

I&#x27;m pretty sure this favors my side of the argument and not yours.<p>&gt; The set of people who can install the app and get this working overlaps hugely with the set of people who can manage basic sync.<p>How can you be so sure about this? Installing an app is much easier than syncing two or more devices. Besides this isn&#x27;t only issue preventing sync, which again you&#x27;re conveniently ignoring.<p>&gt; And people who can&#x27;t afford Android phones are the target market?

"DOCSIS has a very difficult time providing 100+ Mib&#x2F;s connections. It&#x27;s really only possible when the distance to the cabinet is less than 1 km and the number of clients served by that cabinet is less than 50. This is why cable companies are able to offer 300 Mib&#x2F;s connections in urban areas that have a cabinet for every block, but struggle to deliver 50 Mib&#x2F;s connections in suburbs where a whole neighborhood must share a single cabinet. The cost of installing enough cabinets to give everyone 100+ Mib&#x2F;s rapidly approaches the cost of fiber-to-the-premises as population density drops.<p>There is also the issue of the asynchronous nature of DOCSIS. Cable companies must make a trade-off between upstream and downstream bandwith, and tend to assume that people value downstream much more. This is why you see hilarious allocations like 300 Mib&#x2F;s down and only 5 Mib&#x2F;s up."

"Planck length, mass, time and so on are built from the most fundamental physical constants - the speed of light, the Planck constant and the gravitational constant - all of which are independent of the reference frame. But I don&#x27;t think that is actually important.<p>It has more to do with units, i.e. the concrete value of the speed of light is determined by the way we defined the meter and the second and the same holds for the other constants. But that has no physical content, the value 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s is a historical accident and we could as well have ended up with 42 foo&#x2F;bar.<p>So what physicist do is just set those constants to one and get rid of those arbitrary numbers by choosing appropriatei units, e.g. the speed of light becomes one lightyear per year. Because nothing moves faster than the speed you can then also go further and measure velocities with a unitless value as a fraction of the speed of light, i.e. a number between zero and one, as it it appears in the equations of special relativity.<p>So if you throw those constants together in relatively simple expressions like hG&#x2F;c³ you again get one as the numerical value and here for example something with units of area, the Planck area. But there is also no real physical content in the Planck units beyond that.<p>Because the laws of physics usually contain all the constants and values in small powers and with small factor like a Pi here and one half there those units define scales of length, time and so on where the quantities are all about one, nothing is ten to the twenty or minus thirty. So at that scales the laws of physics may show interesting behavior like (1 - v²&#x2F;c²) becoming zero as v approaches c but that are also more like heuristics than hard truths.<p>So to make a long story short, Planck units are frame independent because they are built from constants and they are nice to think in because many things are of order one - a black hole of one Planck mass has probably a horizon of one Planck area or four Pi Planck areas or something small like that - but they are not that special."

I have not followed closely the evolution of the HDD price, but looking now on Amazon I see about 30 EUR per terabyte.<p>I have a data archive of about 120 TB, but I am paranoid because of past data losses due to defective HDDs&#x2F;CDs, so I store 3 copies of each tape (in different places).<p>That means that by using tape instead of HDDs, I have already saved 20 * 360 - 3000 = 4200 EUR.<p>Someone who would store just 2 copies of each tape (the minimum rational value), would need to have a data archive of at least 75 TB to recover the initial cost.<p>Nevertheless saving money is not everything, you also gain peace-of-mind because the chances of the tape becoming defective just from storing are negligible compared to a HDD, which if not used for a very long time might never start spinning again.<p>With tapes you must transfer the data only when you can no longer buy drives that would read them. With HDDs you should better replace them before their warranty expires, as I have seen too many that died immediately after that.<p>The tapes work OK both in Linux and in FreeBSD, but the FreeBSD utilities are more convenient, so I have connected the tape drive to a FreeBSD server and I transfer the data to be archived through 10 Gb&#x2F;s Ethernet, which is faster than the 6 Gb&#x2F;s SAS, so it is not a bottleneck. The writing speed of LTO-7 is 3 Gb&#x2F;s, so that is the bottleneck anyway, not the interfaces.<p>That speed is much faster than of any HDD of up to 8 TB that I have ever used, but I have not checked the latest HDD models to see if they have improved their speed to levels comparable to tapes.<p>Using tape is very simple and retrieving any file (I have a tape index on my SSDs) takes at most 3 minutes, including the time to manually start the drive and inserting a tape in the drive. The maximum seek time is about 2 minutes. When I had a HDD archive, there was still the same time for manually selecting a HDD and inserting it in the HDD rack. For retrieving very large files, the tape can even be faster, due to the faster sequential speed.<p>The conclusion is that if you have data of at least several tens of terabytes and&#x2F;or if you value that data enough to want to avoid any chance of losing it, than magnetic tape remains the best solution for now."
"I just bought the Thunderbolt 3 Drobo, and realize it&#x27;s completely pointless without SSDs. It advertises 40 Gbit speeds when using an active Thunderbolt 3 cable, but only gets about 200 MB&#x2F;s with normal drives. I could probably get close to that with the USB drobo."

"&gt; basically you shouldn&#x27;t expect your code to block on disk io. But even if it does block for a very short amount of time it&#x27;s probably fine.<p>No, it&#x27;s very often not fine. Magnetic disks, still the norm for many, and definitely with large storage, often go as low as 5KB&#x2F;s for random access (or even sequential access to very fragmented files). Reading a 1MB file can easily take 5-10 seconds in some setups - which is not acceptable for any interactive service. It&#x27;s not fine for a web server to not service any requests for 5 seconds.<p>&gt; Another option is to use modern APIs like aio in Linux, but as far as I know almost nobody uses it for real.<p>Anyone I know who tried came back screaming. There is no way to do an async file open, for example - which means that if you rely on aio, you can block for 10 minutes waiting for an NFS or SMB mounted file to open.<p>The only sane, portable thing to do for Unix&#x2F;Posix is use a threadpool for async file io - or just use something like libuv which already abstracted async operations this way."

"1. It is much easier to land on&#x2F;get into the orbit of a planet. For example, transfer from low earth orbit to Mars requires a delta V of about 4.3 km&#x2F;s. Now to get into Mars&#x27; orbit, this needs to be reduced to about 3 km&#x2F;s (rough napkin-top calculation, take with a grain of salt). However if you want to &quot;stop&quot; at a massless orbital platform&#x2F;asteroid, you would have to reduce all 4.3 km&#x2F;s (without any aerobrake assist).<p>2. If we assume an orbital platform is like a ring (similar to Halo), and if the diameter of this thing is 2km, then it would need to spin very fast (70m&#x2F;s). This is okay, until you realize, that so much speed means a lot of difference in gravity from the floor to ceiling. For example, a man who is 2m tall, would feel 1g on his feet and about 0.95g = 9.3m&#x2F;s^2 on his head. The difference in g would give rise to different health issues. You could make the station bigger, but then it would be probably better to stick to a natural body that is similar size instead"
"For feature analysis (should we enable this new feature) I think Bayesian approaches are far better.<p>I work in a slightly different space, which is qualification of builds (this assumes you have feature flags and code, and the code shouldn&#x27;t enable features, but it may include refactoring, as well as the code that will later be enabled by a flag etc.)<p>For this, I originally wanted to push my org to do things in a more Bayesian, but it didn&#x27;t work.

"Another discussion thread has noted that LPDDR4x can be 16x bits or 32x bits.<p>DDR4 is always 64-bits. Two channel DDR4 is 128-bits. So right there, 2-channel x 64bits DDR4 is the same bus-width as the 8-channel x 16bits LPDDR4x.<p>With that being said, 8-channel LPDDR4x is more than most I&#x27;ve heard of.

There are some orbital mechanics problems.  You can&#x27;t &quot;steer&quot; in orbit.  Shoving down at any sane rate results in going up half an orbit later.

"No, the poster already said the above should be enough for anyone. &#x2F;s"
"I&#x27;ve read through the article and it turns out to me that he wrote it to show he was lucky enough not to experience a multi-disk RAID failure. Personally I owned dozens of HDDs across almost all brands from desktop&#x2F;laptop HDDS to Enterprise HDDs or NAS HDDs and almost half of them had bad sectors with a life span of a couple of months to a few years, some of which even broke in a row in a few days. The only exception is that in my last batch of 5 Seagate NAS drives, there was no single failure after around 4 years and I think I&#x27;m just been lucky with those as I did hear quite a few people were complaining about the same model.<p>Due to the nature of how HDD works, the surfaces of the disks have more or less defects leaving the factory and were graded by the count of defects, and even the enterprise grade one are not free of defects. Those defects and adjacent areas then are masked by the firmware so that magnetic heads won&#x27;t trying to read&#x2F;write to&#x2F;from them. But that won&#x27;t prevent them from growing. The factories are very clean but the dusts in the air are simply impossible to avoid and if one lands on the disk, it&#x27;s a time bomb. Also as the disks&#x27; capacity grows, the tracks get narrower and narrower. The disks spins from 5400 rpm to 15000 rpm maybe even faster and the magnetic heads are gliding micros from the disk and if the heads touch the disk surface, it almost for sure to create a bad sector event bad tracks. And again, the vibrations are impossible to avoid. Making it even worse, the contact are almost guaranteed to generate debris to be scattered to the whole disk, event goes to other disks sealed in the same case. The bigger capacity, the narrower the track will be, the less tolerant to such contact. Based on the fact, I really don&#x27;t see where he got the confidence the disks people bought were not going to have bad sectors during their expected life span.<p>Also the disks people use to build the RAID are most likely the same brand, the same model and the same batch and thus if one started to have bad sectors, most likely the others are going to have them soon or even worse may already have them. Even if the other disks in the array do not have bad sectors at the time of the failure, they are highly likely going to have during the rebuilding process, why? The load. Take a 10TB drive as an example, my Seagate 10 NAS drive can deliver ~180MB&#x2F;s peak writing and ~80MB&#x2F;s at the trough. Let&#x27;s assume it can deliver 100MB&#x2F;s all the way, and the disk is half full it will almost take 14 hours to finish, this load is highly likely to push other drives to the limit. For RAID6 allows another 1 to fail. For RAID5, if another drive failed during rebuilding, you data is gone. If you had to rebuild a 12 bays NAS, you would know how frustrating it could be, especially when there were secondary failures.<p>Software RAID may somehow alleviate the problem a little bit but it will also cover up the issue. My experience was that once there is one single bad sector, there will be lots of them soon, if you don&#x27;t back up the data and replace the faulty drive on spot, most likely it will be too late.<p>All above does not event consider the setup and quirks of NAS or RAID cards. Put all those issue aside, what&#x27;s are the benefits of RAID for home users? IMO, almost NIL. Our home network device most likely are Gigabyte ones with 1 Gbps ports, which can only deliver about 100MB&#x2F;s, you can see that a single drive can almost saturate that bandwidth even with link aggregation. And most people does not need the random IO boost or extra large volumes come with RAID.<p>My suggestion for home users is to go single drive and stay away from RAID."

"It&#x27;s not as rare as you might think. All sun-synchronous orbits are slightly retrograde (inclination = 98 degrees or so at 600 km) in order to take advantage of the precession caused by the earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge and maintain the same local solar time in the ground track.<p>Also, Israel always launches in a retrograde orbit, since they have neighbors to the east who would react too well to what looks for all intents and purposes like a missile launch, or to expended rocket stages dropped on their heads. For that reason, Israel launches retrograde over the Mediterranean.<p>Even neglecting a retrograde orbit, though, just a slight difference in inclination is enough to totally ruin your day. Even if you&#x27;re only off by one degree, if you&#x27;re travelling at 7.8 km&#x2F;s your closing perpendicular velocity at the node crossing is 7800*sin(1 degree) = 136 m&#x2F;s. That&#x27;s almost 500 km&#x2F;h, plenty fast enough to ruin your day."
"For all the cases you mention, the critical factor is the product of the average transaction size and the transaction count per second. As long as this value is smaller than the RAM bandwidth, the application will not be RAM bandwidth-bound.<p>Generally speaking, databases are kept in memory to minimize latency, not maximize throughput. Bandwidth is not really a problem. Having to update 10 GB&#x2F;s of a database would be highly unusual. Having to get data from random positions in a disk or SSD is much more common.<p>As for the message broken, it&#x27;s not clear to me why the bandwidth would &quot;of course&quot; be the limiting factor."
"Its kind of a chicken and egg problem.  I&#x27;m not aware of any consumer 2.5&#x2F;5G switches, and 10Gbase-T switches are still more than 10x as expensive as 1Gb&#x2F;s switches.<p>There&#x27;s also the lack of a compelling use case.  Most consumer NAS boxes are still based on spinning drives, and 1Gb&#x2F;s is still a reasonable match for a spinning drive.<p>I&#x27;ve had 10GbE equipment in my house for about 12 years (I worked remotely and did drivers for one of the first 10GbE NICS), but I&#x27;ve never had &gt; 1 Gb&#x2F;s equipment in anything but lab equipment.

"Of the currently shipping products SSD has the highest density. Samsung has a 2.5&quot; 15 TB SSD. The closest magnetic storage is 12TB 3.5&quot;.<p>Another important factor to remember is that your HDD will give you 200 MB&#x2F;s of sequential data. If you have a random pattern it&#x27;s going to drop to 10 MB&#x2F;s or less. (15K RPM SAS drives can do around 150-170 random IOPS, assume 32 KB per operation and you&#x27;re looking at 6 MB&#x2F;s.) SSD will push out 10x+ that rate for random IOPS. A 100 TB HDD sitting behind 200 MB&#x2F;s is painful but sitting behind 5 MB&#x2F;s is insane. There&#x27;s a place for such devices, but it&#x27;s not serving your OLTP databases or kafka message queues."
"Sounds higher than a nuclear reactor, for which you can find data on nucleate boiling without forced flow to support about 10W&#x2F;cm^2 without much risk of reaching critical heat flux (in the strict sense, as you then transition to a vapor isolation due to the surface rapidly heating beyond the temperature where nucleate boiling is sustained, and from what I remember&#x2F;believe, you won&#x27;t transition back without reducing the surface temperature to be below that at critical heat flux, possibly even lower due to the lack of agitation&#x2F;uniformity of the vapor layer).<p>I did some research into what can be archived with suitable dielectric fluids and nucleate boiling to allow much higher heat flux on the surface of the silicon without requiring any energy input to actually separate hot and cold, but allowing the use of pumps and such to provide forced flow on the silicon. It seems that if you have a nozzle to provide sufficient flow speeds across the die you can get higher critical heat flux than can be reasonably handled through the power pins on an AMD EPYC socket, which has some limitations due to the LGA technology used for the contacts. A zero-insertion-force PGA socket should not be bound by this limit of temperature rise at the contact of the LGA spring&#x2F;pin and the chip contact pad due to resistive heating resulting in the contact pressure declining (due to the spring weakening), which yields a feedback loop that can jump over to a domino effect on the other nearby power pins.<p>I remember the flow rate being proportional to the critical heat flux as well as the distance the flow from the nozzle has to cross and provide cooling for. There  were speeds of iirc. about 20m&#x2F;s if one were to cool a delidded AMD EPYC at maximum power draw @4GHz, or rather, extrapolating from what can be archived with a die surface temperature of 50 degree Celsius.<p>So, yeah, the heat flux is actually a problem, but I think one could integrate some sensors and sufficiently fast switches that shut the section of the die off if the temperature reaches dangerous levels (and do so fast enough to not damage anything, i.e. microseconds or what time there is), and use such a test chip to engineer a forced-flow direct-die (or maybe even with a heat spreader on top, but that costs you due to the nucleate boiling not going below 20 kelvin temperature loss, and additional system losses in the radiator&#x2F;heat exchanger as well as pipes likely resulting in costs of about 5 additional kelvin). This could open the door to operating CPU dies at much, much higher power densities than currently normal. It&#x27;s like a heat pipe on steroids. One would want circuity in the CPU to rapidly shut down in case the temperature rises quickly, as regardless of why this happens, not doing so will literally blow a hole in the chip before you can drain the inductors providing smooth power to the socket."

  *Similarly you don&#x27;t want to copy these things unless you have to so a strategy where each filter is responsible for its own buffers will result in roughly a 3x factor in memory bandwidth.
  *All of the downstream software is written in C. So just to get it into GO I either need to do another memcpy or use unsafe stuff in order to deal with it nativly in Go.  This along with the above means that I would be looking at 2GB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth per stream instead of 500MB&#x2F;s for a 4K stream.
  *My upstream targets include software written in Python and C#.  Go appears to assume that it owns main, which is obviously a problem.</code></pre>"

"Your experiment has several fundamental flaws. Firstly, dark matter is weakly interacting (even with itself) which is why it doesn&#x27;t &quot;clump&quot; the way atomic matter does. The only &quot;clumping&quot; of dark matter happens on galactic scales, because the typical speeds of dark matter particles are in the range of orbital speeds around galaxies. Our measurements of the dark matter mass in galaxies don&#x27;t have nearly enough precision to be able to determine the relationship you posit with much certainty.<p>As to your own experimental design, using large spheres of matter, it&#x27;s completely non-workable. As mentioned above, dark matter particles have velocities in the range of orbital speeds around the galaxy, which is 100s of km&#x2F;s. So most of the dark matter particles in the vicinity of Earth are going to simply pass through your spheres without stopping, and certainly without increasing their mass.<p>Additionally, you seem to be confused about the scales of densities here. Dark matter is distributed in a somewhat uniform density on interstellar scales (there are density gradients across the galaxy however). Near the Sun the density of dark matter is about 0.0025 solar masses per cubic light-year, or about 5e-20 kg per cubic meter. So, there really is not a lot of dark matter passing through objects around Earth, mass wise. There&#x27;s only maybe 6 kg within the entire volume of the Earth at any given time, for example."

That makes things awkward even if you&#x27;re not a malicious person. And if you&#x27;re higher up the chain of command, it&#x27;s easy to still think that someone&#x27;s success is derailing your master plan (and sometimes it&#x27;s even true).

We need to figure out what to do for the next century.<p>Personally, I think we should at least look at the local loop as a natural monopoly. Just like the city is expected to own and maintain the road to your house, it should own and maintain the digital equivalent. From your house to the POP, it&#x27;s city fiber. From the POP onward, sure, let that be run commercially, with a free minimum tier, say 5 mb&#x2F;s. If you want anything more, you can contract with any ISP who has a presence in your POP.

"Capitalism is great when it&#x27;s many companies competing. That&#x27;s the kind of capitalism I support. Capitalism isn&#x27;t so great when a highly in demand market is largely geographically controlled by very few, with that control also being largely governmentally involved because part of its product is now essential infrastructure.<p>There are thresholds for when how markets operate starts to have effects that have sizeable socioeconomic effects. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hyperbole to claim that the Internet is now an essential part of U.S. commerce with itself and the world. Whenever we talk about physical commerce, like stores or driving to work, we generally agree we need some form of government oversight and regulation so that the commerce can keep flowing.<p>For example if a highway has a wreck it can prevent millions of dollars being earned all across the board. This is in part why we have road safety standards, and standards for the vehicles that can be on it.<p>I think the internet is similiar in some ways. We now use it for work in lots of places. For government applications, and to buy and sell a significant amount of goods. Entertainment is included as services and goods.<p>When we consider commerce flowing freely we have to also consider the real bottlenecks to it in relation to monopalistic control. Is netflix&#x27;s bandwidth actually a significant stress for Comcasts networks? If it is, is it because netflix&#x27;s bandwidth is inherently too large for what Comcast can realistically afford, or is it because Comcast does not want to innovate and&#x2F;or improve their infrastructure?<p>I was surprised when I found you can get a 1Gb&#x2F;s dedicated line through Cogent or Hurricane Electric for about $150. This is transit network that has very low latency, and they&#x27;re much smaller companies than U.S. ISP&#x27;s. Residential internet is not dedicated, it&#x27;s shared. I don&#x27;t have the data on how much is actually used but I highly suspect only about 1&#x2F;20th is used by most people overall, if not less.<p>I think as it stands right now, it&#x27;s ISP&#x27;s lack of competition leading to lack of effort to provide a good product. Given their position and lack of effort they are the ones who are actually hurting free commerce.<p>If they are hurting free commerce then what should be done about it? Well, as I originally stated, ISP&#x27;s are in the business of infrastructure. You don&#x27;t have realistic alternatives that <i>do</i> allow that commerce (In this case, bandwidth). So, do we just ignore commerce for the country being limited, or do we force the hand?<p>I think forcing the hand is a bandaid, but a true solution, competition, is much further out of reach. Any time anti-monopalization is brought up you get the same notions of &#x27;free market&#x27; saying no, when monopalization puts down free markets."

"Apparently it has a diameter 60% larger than that of the Earth, and so if we assume it has the same density as the Earth it would have about 16m&#x2F;s^2 gravity on the surface, and an orbital velocity of around 12km&#x2F;s @ ~1000km (in comparison to the Earth, where a 1000km circular orbit is closer to 7km&#x2F;s).<p>This means that merely achieving orbit would be approximately as difficult as launching a probe on a Hohmann transfer orbit to Mars is.

"This is a question I&#x27;ve asked myself before too.  Here&#x27;s a back-of-envelope calculation which seems to suggest that diffusion alone will never be enough to keep someone alive inside a box.  I&#x27;d be really interested to hear if someone can confirm or refute this.<p>Let&#x27;s assume CO2 transfer is entirely diffusion-limited, i.e. the worst-case of completely still air.  The diffusive flux of some gas-component (per unit area per unit time) J is governed by concentration-gradient (dn&#x2F;dx) multiplied by a magic diffusion coefficient D, which depends on the molecular properties of the gas.  For CO2 in air D = 1.6e-5 m^2&#x2F;s.  Let&#x27;s assume the gradient is linear so dn&#x2F;dx = (n_{inside} - n_{outside}) &#x2F; length. Now n_{outside) = 0.04% * 1 kg&#x2F;m^3 = 4e-4 kg&#x2F;m^3.  We should decide what level of CO2 we can tolerate, 0.5% should be on the safe side, so n_{inside} = 5e-3 kg&#x2F;m^3.<p>Length is a bit trickier.  If (a) we assume completely stagnant air inside and outside, length should be chosen as the size of the box ~1 m say.  However if (b) we assume that inside and outside are pretty well-mixed <i>individually</i>, due by breathing, wind etc., then length should be about the depth of the hole, or thickness of the box-material, say 1 cm = 0.01 m.  For case (a) CO2 leaves our box at a rate of about 7e-8 kg&#x2F;s&#x2F;m^2, for (b) 7e-6 kg&#x2F;s&#x2F;m^2.<p>From the original article, a human breaths .84 kg of O2&#x2F;day, let&#x27;s estimate a production of 1kg CO2&#x2F;day (the extra carbon atom can&#x27;t be all <i>that</i> significant), or 1e-5 kg&#x2F;s.<p>To compute the area of hole needed to maintain 0.5% CO2, we just divide 1e-5 by J, to get the area.  In case (a) we need an enormous area of 135 m^2, in (b) &quot;only&quot; 1.35 m^2.<p>This seems to suggest that &quot;air-holes&quot; must work (if indeed they work at all) with air-flow.  This doesn&#x27;t necessary require an over- or under-pressure in the box - a suction can be generated by wind passing over a box with holes on both sides - this process would be far more efficient at restoring atmosphere than diffusion.  But would be less reliable."

"I&#x27;ve tried using Google&#x27;s AutoML to classify medical images as part of a Kaggle competition just to see what their process is like and how well it performs. This was Q4 2018, so things might have changed slightly.<p>In brief, my experience was quite frustrating. First, getting my dataset to the cloud required quite a bit of manual labor. Uploading my 25GB of images on my 40mbit&#x2F;s wasn&#x27;t really ideal so I ended up spawning an virtual machine on GCP and downloading directly from Kaggle. Unzipping the files and writing it to Google Cloud storage with some terminal commands.<p>Furthermore, to get the label data into AutoML I had to write some generation script that generated the exact format CSV that AutoML requires - which was hidden in their documentation somewhere with no mention in the AutoML environment itself.<p>Nothing too cumbersome but generally not a very user friendly experience, or something I wish to repeat many times if I get a new&#x2F;different dataset.<p>Ultimately, when the data with labels was in the model started training. Then I found, that I didn&#x27;t really have the tools and information to assess the model performance. They did a decent job of characterizing model performance through precision recall graphs and displaying incorrect predictions but that didn&#x27;t really satisfy me. I was interested in getting more details about where it was misclassifying images, specifically how classification performance was distributed across the 28 classes the model was predicting (in a multi label context).<p>This is the point where I think the downside of working with a platform such as AutoML starts showing. I tried reaching out to someone about gaining more insight into model performance by opening a ticket, since there was no phone number. After a couple of days I finally received an email from a product representative that told me that for any assistance I should contact one of their local cloud partners.<p>These are third party vendors that typically assist companies in deploying cloud based applications in the GCP. However, after calling two of these companies that were highly recommended by Google&#x27;s vendor page I was told that they don&#x27;t have any experience with AutoML and that I was on my own. The other company didn&#x27;t reply at all.<p>In my view, choosing a product such as AutoML - for a company that is serious about adopting AI to improve their business - is currently not a good path (yet). And I see this space as being wide open for competition with current solutions not cutting it from my point of view."

"Rabbit doesn&#x27;t have Kafka&#x27;s ability to massively distribute and scale (it does have a distributed story but from what I hear few explore it).

In addition, we have the circumference in ms so we want to convert that into a distance or the radius into ms so we need the speed the Earth is rotating around the sun.<p>The average radius of the Earth to the Sun is 149,600,000 km so the diameter is 299,200,000 km. Earth&#x27;s average orbital speed is 30 km&#x2F;s or 0.03 km&#x2F;ms.

I&#x27;m in Portugal but it&#x27;s probably common throughout Europe. In urban areas having at least 2 and often 3 providers that can give you a reasonably priced 50 or 100Mb&#x2F;s connection is common these days. Rural areas are harder but it&#x27;s actually improving a bit. I&#x27;ve recently been upgraded from a flakey 8Mb&#x2F;s ADSL with &lt;1Mb&#x2F;s upload to 100Mb&#x2F;s symmetrical over fiber in an agricultural area where previously there wasn&#x27;t much competition between ISPs. I think the combination of LTE offerings and cheaper fiber technology may have tipped the scales making a simple fibre installation on existing telephone poles an attractive proposition for the ISP.

"I believe it&#x27;s the backhaul capacity that&#x27;s the problem. Even assuming &quot;only&quot; 1 MBit&#x2F;s constant traffic per customer, an uplink of 1 GBit&#x2F;s can only handle a thousand clients tops.<p>Cheap-ish providers are worse - they usually don&#x27;t run fiber to every tower because laying fiber is expensive, but instead only to one tower which then distributes uplink via directional microwave to nearby towers. Once that link gets saturated or has issues, the whole area is screwed.<p>Providers like Deutsche Telekom (or other former monopolists) usually have it easier as they have huuuge amounts of fiber and especially conduits in the ground, which means it&#x27;s easier for them to wire up even small towers with real dedicated fiber uplink."
"It&#x27;s doing 12k rows in 3k user-issued write operations&#x2F;transaction per second.<p>Counting any kind of &quot;internal write effects&quot; that result from a user write (i.e. write amplification) is obviously done to mislead in the benchmark and does not make it comparable to key-value stores.<p>12k writes&#x2F;s is the number of rows that are written from a user perspective. So 12k&#x2F;s is also the number you have to use when comparing it to key value stores. But of course, comparing Fauna with eventually consistent systems is not a really fair comparison. You don&#x27;t make it fairer by misleading in your benchmark though.<p>Also, just because some other vendor posted a misleading benchmark on hn (I don&#x27;t know if they did) that doesn&#x27;t make it right or means you should do it.

"What&#x27;s <i>really</i> freaky is that the RTX 30xx series of cards aren&#x27;t even being manufactured on the current-gen process!<p>NVIDIA is using Samsung&#x27;s 8nm process, which has about 60 million transistors per square millimetre (MTr&#x2F;mm^2).<p>That&#x27;s not cutting edge! The crown is currently held by TSCM&#x27;s 5nm process, at 173 MTr&#x2F;mm^2.<p>Some time next year, TSMC is starting &quot;risk production&quot; of their 3 nm process, which is expected to hit about 300 MTr&#x2F;mm^2. That&#x27;s a solid FIVE TIMES higher density than the process used for the RTX 30xx series.<p>Unlike general-purpose CPUs, where transistor density does not linearly translate to real-world performance, GPUs are designed for embarrassingly parallel problems and have nearly linear scaling. More transistors equals more &quot;CUDA cores&quot; equals more performance.<p>The only thing holding back GPU performance is memory bandwidth. Current-gen <i>consumer</i> cards are just shy of 1 TB&#x2F;s of memory bandwidth, but to get 5x performance, they would need 5 TB&#x2F;s memory throughput to match. That&#x27;s... difficult. Even with HBM2E, you&#x27;d need to stack a bunch of them to get near that.<p>But yeah. 8K gaming is crazy.

"&quot;best effort, capped at $speed&quot; is not transparent, it&#x27;s just different wording for &quot;up to $speed&quot;. &quot;Best effort&quot; is a completely meaningless term in this context, as it is completely up to the ISP to decide how much infrastructure they build, and thus what speed you can achieve. There is no fundamental reason why an ISP could not provide you full 100 Gb&#x2F;s duplex 24&#x2F;7 at any point whatsoever on this planet--it is all a matter of how much money they decide to spend on it, which is not your problem as a customer. So, wording of that kind in effect simply means &quot;we don&#x27;t owe you anything in particular, we will decide after the fact what you get in exchange for the payments that you owe us.&quot;<p>The point of actually transparent marketing is not to directly improve the connectivity you get, but to enable a market to actually work. If customers cannot know what service they will be getting for their money, then competition cannot possibly work. Imagine all packages in the grocery store were labeled with &quot;up to 1 liter&quot; or &quot;up to 1 kg&quot;, and no way to weigh them yourself before you buy them ... how would that possibly allow the better product to win out? What if someone truthfully labeled their product &quot;100 g&quot; ... how could people figure out whether that&#x27;s the better product than the &quot;up to 1 kg&quot; package right next to it?<p>Nothing guarantees that better products would actually happen, but at least, if they do get offered, customers would have some chance to actually know, and thus for the better product to gain customers."

"&gt; I’ve limited document size to 10mb and rate-limited updates to 10 per second. Client starts to update document with random data 10 requests per second. As far as I understand couch stores all versions at least some time. This means that this one client could fill space on my server 100mb&#x2F;s. There is no such issues with PostgreSQL, and no one allow clients execute raw queries on database without any application server. Document only 10mb but database is huge.<p>Ah! Now we are getting somewhere! Your concerned about someone filling your disk.<p>OK, let&#x27;s modify your scenario a little. Instead of updating an existing document, they create a new document. This a malicious client, why do updates that&#x27;ll get cleaned up in a few minutes when I can make it permanent?<p>So, CouchDB allows these writes, and now your disk is full.<p>What does Postgres with a custom API do? Allows these writes, and now your disk is full.<p>Your allowing 10MB documents because that makes sense for your application right? So your Postgres table is going to have a binary column or some other column meant to hold bulk data, and your API is going to accept it.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t make sense, lower the max document size. Apply validations to limit what fields can be written to, and how big they can be. In Postgres this is called your &quot;schema&quot;. Couch being &quot;schemaless&quot;, it&#x27;s now your validation function. Couch is no different from any other schemaless database such as Mongo, RethinkDB and FoundationDB in this regard.<p>Also your rate limiting here is weak. If I can post to your sever at 100Mb&#x2F;s second, I can saturate a 1GB link with only 10 clients. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you reject my posts, if I can send them to the server, I can DOS you pretty easily.<p>The main thing Postgres gives you here is that it requires you to define your schema upfront (unless you use JSON columns, in which case it joins the schemaless club above). Couch will happily let you not, in which case someone wants to write a record of their car maintenance into your recipe book app? Couch is good with that. But take a step back. what actually stops them from putting that in the &quot;description&quot; column of your Postgres recipe app? Not much. So you have to think about what&#x27;s important. Do I actually need to make sure these are all the same &quot;shape&quot;? If so I need a validation function. If I can just shrug and say &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;, then I just need controls around how much data they can insert, but hey, I needed that for Postgres anyway.<p>&gt; Sorry for my ignorance, is it true that if I limit couch only to replication it will not be any not indexed lookups?<p>Correct (enough). The entirety of CouchDB is built around efficient replication. While it&#x27;s not going to use a formal &quot;index&quot; getting all of the changes after a specific rev is an efficient operation."

"In a study that is due to be published in the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, René Heller from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany, and colleagues, propose the spacecraft as a precursor to interstellar travel—beyond our own solar system. They estimate a prototype would cost around $1 million, while the launch of an interplanetary mission would be around $10 million.<p>The spacecraft would be made from aerographite. This is a carbon-based foam that is around 15,000 times more lightweight than aluminium. It is versatile and light enough that it could be used to create solar sails—which harness energy from the sun for propulsion, a process called solar photon pressure.
...
The team found if its shell was just 0.5 millimeters thick and the spacecraft was released from Earth, it could reach Mars in 60 days and Pluto in 4.3 years—less than half the time it took New Horizons. Heller said these spacecraft could travel far faster than any probe ever sent by humans before. &quot;Voyager 1 currently recedes from the Sun with a speed of 17 km&#x2F;s (10.5mp&#x2F;s). Solar photon sails made of graphene could, in principle, go beyond 100 km&#x2F;s (62mps) or even 1000 km&#x2F;s (620mps)."

It isn&#x27;t.<p>Any other European capital is really nice or at least tries its best to be nice, Berlin is just &quot;meh, don&#x27;t care&quot;.<p>Financial power is not concentrated there, nor is industrial power. Companies (and what you might call &quot;startup&quot;) have some outposts in Berlin because it&#x27;s chic to have something in Berlin. It sprays the scent of being wealthy (enough), while the real major cities are in the Ruhrgebiet, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart (in loose order) and those are the places big companies have their headquarters and never really thought about moving to Berlin.<p>Tourists like Berlin because it&#x27;s so shabby, but that&#x27;s about everything that city got. It&#x27;s some strange kind of fascination for disgust and decay that attracts the people.<p>Germans don&#x27;t like Berlin. It&#x27;s hyped for nothing and you can find better jobs and better places to live all over the country.<p>Right now I&#x27;m kind of living in the middle of nowhere in south-west Germany near the French border and I got 100 MBit&#x2F;s internet connection, so not even that is better in Berlin."

Akonadi really annoys me. Who thought it would be a good idea to run mysql on each desktop to store email metadata? That&#x27;s just ridiculous bloat. Mysql is among the top 10 entries for me in powertop. Why would MySQL be needed to deal with the metadata? All other mail applications seem to do fine with Maildir and an index.<p>And in case anybody thought that using MySQL would allow them to scale (you know because people receiving a million mails&#x2F;s is such a common use case) then the answer is no! Thanks to Nepomuk many operations were bound by the RDF triple store they used. Maybe it has improved now thanks to Baloo. But once I tried to delete a folder containing a mailing list with a few thousand mails and I wondered why my laptop got so hot until I realised that Nepomuk was struggling.<p>Maybe the situation has improved now though. But the whole KMail transition was really painful for no tangible benefits to the user. This really feels like a prime example of overengineering.
"In rural areas it&#x27;s quite a bit different.<p>Where I am in rural southern Missouri, I&#x27;ve got very few choices.<p>1. Mediacom - horrible customer service, decent speed when it works but sometimes unreliable. Data caps on all accounts.<p>2. Centurylink DSL - horribly slow and horribly small data caps.<p>3. TotalHighspeed - 3 megabits for $75&#x2F;month via Wifi dish.<p>4. Verizon LTE - ~$100 for a 15 gigabyte per month data cap, then it&#x27;s throttled to ~600kbit&#x2F;s once 15 gigs is used.<p>Note that the only one that doesn&#x27;t have explicit data caps and multi-year contracts is the tiny WISP with extremely slow service. Verizon and Mediacom both have 2 year contracts with cancellation fees. Centurylink has data caps so small that it isn&#x27;t even worth considering. Most of these options are only available inside city limits, if you live far out of town your only option is Verizon or a Satellite provider with outrageous latency and data caps.<p>Government might not always do a good job providing service but I&#x27;d love to see literally any new competition enter the market."

"Reporting can be surprisingly complicated. You can allow users to run raw SQL queries, or have a reporting interface that is basically is an SQL query builder behind the scenes, and have extremely powerful reporting abilities. The problem is you might have a user create a query that takes 5 minutes to run, and then refresh the page 15 times killing your db server&#x2F;s. Many places have a separate DB read replica (or multiple replicas) just to allow this type of reporting run by certain users.<p>For an environment like shopify (which I&#x27;ve never used, so speculating), their reports are much more likely optimized database queries or views, or even created from specially stored statistics data not from querying raw db tables, with caching or pre-generation at some point. This means there&#x27;s a lot of thought behind every report, and what&#x27;s possible with the current db&#x2F;stats schema. Adding a column to a report might mean modifying the db schema.<p>The final issue is that user interface complexity goes up as reporting flexibility goes up. A super powerful interface that few people take the time to use is worth less than a limited interface that provides value to more people. The task is attempting to satisfy power users and more complex needs, while providing a very useful default functionality out of the box."

"I hope you are right, and I&#x27;m wrong. I suspect this is a temporary, happy circumstance that we enjoy today, due to the segment of history we inhabit, but am concerned it will be reversed due to physics, further market segmentation, and an ongoing miniaturization mania.<p>As semiconductor fabrication processes get smaller, die sizes larger, and operating frequencies higher, I think we will see the hardware become more opaque. Already the test equipment to hack on cutting edge workstation- and server-class processors is spendy; just a 2GHz 10GS&#x2F;s oscilloscope is 5 figures USD $ even used and just-calibrated. As manufacturers head towards greater integration on the die to differentiate themselves in a furiously- and constantly-commoditizing industry, we&#x27;ll likely see more binary blobs at first, then market segmentation hits those of us who want open&#x2F;powerful gear with a double-whammy. We enjoy the fruits of commodified hardware components now, but I&#x27;m not sanguine that state of affairs will last indefinitely due to the aforementioned integration trends.<p>As everyone noticed that personalized gear enjoys outsized margins, we&#x27;re seeing ever-increased pressure to further integrate and miniaturize into smaller packaging; repairability and accessibility to the hardware not invited at all to the design party. I really wish this specific trend would reverse.<p>I suspect that the PC as we know it will morph into a greater walled-garden device in the next several decades, and if we want open&#x2F;powerful gear we will find ourselves in a tiny market segment. At best, paying very high prices for the small volumes catered to, and at worst, in a technology ghetto.<p>For now, I agree with you, but the long-term constraints are not promising to me further openness of the hardware."

"My experience is entirely based around using the service through their REST API, so probably not relevant to your case specifically, but perhaps useful for others.  $60&#x2F;yr for unlimited is impossible to beat for my use case (&gt;4TB of data with potential for downloading most of that).<p>The REST API is dodgy at the best of times.  About 1 in 4 requests fail with random errors (Internal Server Error, Timeout, TooManyRequests, Temporarily Unavailable, etc).  The API has an aggressive authentication scheme that requires re-auth every 5 minutes or so.  Detecting when re-auth is needed is done by waiting for an Unauthorized error on any request.  At least, that&#x27;s what the spec says.  What actually happens is that it returns 401 sometimes, and other times it returns a generic 4xx or 5xx class error with the error&#x27;s message mentioning that the auth token has expired (sometimes the error message even says 401 Unauthorized, even though the actual error code isn&#x27;t 401).<p>Upload speed is quite bad, in part due to the constant errors requiring re-tries and backoff, but mostly because the total response round-trip time is slow.  This is particularly cumbersome for many small uploads.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been getting waves of TooManyRequests errors, where it will only return TooManyRequests for a day, or even a whole week, making the service unavailable to me (currently in contact with them to see if this can get fixed).<p>So in other words, I&#x27;ve been using the service for about 5 months and managed to upload only ~1TB of data to the drive (on a 20Mb&#x2F;s up line).  From what I hear the official client suffers similar issues in terms of sync-ing speed.<p>For $60&#x2F;yr and no real alternative for me, I feel I&#x27;m getting what I pay for.

At 1000km, that support is 78km tall.<p>The only economical way to do even part of it would be to build an evacuated acceleration track up the side of an existing mountain.  The west face of Chimborazo in Ecuador is probably the ideal location for something like that.  But you would need to accelerate at 23g for about 283km (51s) in order to reach escape velocity without any additional boost after the launch vehicle exits the track.  That would be strictly for unmanned missions.<p>Accelerating at 3g for 283km (139s) to a height of 6268m above equatorial sea level would achieve 4080m&#x2F;s, of an escape velocity of 11170m&#x2F;s.  You get 465 m&#x2F;s for free by being near the equator.  That leaves a delta-v of 6625 m&#x2F;s.  If your launch vehicle used RS-25 rocket engines, that means an extra 13% of your total launch vehicle mass can be cargo instead of propellant.  The acceleration track would effectively substitute for the first stage of a rocket.<p>In order to reach escape velocity externally at 80 km above the equator (7850 m&#x2F;s), you need 250 seconds at 3g (29.42 m*s^-2) of acceleration, which takes 1850 km.  This is why the launch loop uses tethers instead of towers, and supports itself mainly with tension rather than compression."

"&gt; This map highlights working land in Texas, including depleted land near the Ocean that would meet the requirements<p>Texas probably isn&#x27;t a great launch site since the vast majority of launch trajectories would take you over populated land at some point or another. There are only narrow corridors between Mexico&#x2F;Cuba and Cuba&#x2F;Florida, and that&#x27;s far too limiting to be worth using as a launch site.<p>&gt; A few degrees upwards would not drastically change the ∆v savings acquired.<p>In this case, moving the launch site from Boca Chica (approximate latitude 18.5 degrees north) to southern Texas (approximate latitude 26 degrees north) would result in geostationary orbit insertion burns needing 139 m&#x2F;s of extra delta v. Not entirely sure how that translates to restrictions on payload size&#x2F;lifetime.<p>&gt; They can test fire and develop rockets anywhere, including, say, farm land in Kansas or other states.<p>They <i>can</i>, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it&#x27;s a good idea. IIRC rockets tend to be awkward to move around, with larger ones needing barge access, so being able to develop, test, and launch from the same place probably makes things more convenient. Whether that convenience is worth the cost to the development area, though, is another question."

"I&#x2F;O parallelism is necessary but far from sufficient. My own designs arbitrarily allow 64 reads and 64 writes to be in-flight concurrently per core. There is no science behind that limit beyond the fact it has worked brilliantly for many years across every type of storage. But I&#x2F;O parallelism won&#x27;t fix terrible scheduling.<p>A fast storage engine needs to eliminate most of the elements that will stall an execution pipeline. This means doing things like almost completely eliminating shared data structures and context switching. It also means designing your own execution and I&#x2F;O scheduler to greatly reduce the various forms of stalling on memory ubiquitous in many designs. It is difficult to overstate the extent to which thoughtful schedule design can greatly improve throughput.<p>A state-of-the-art storage engine can drive 2+ GB&#x2F;s <i>per core</i>, and schedule things to keep the storage hardware performance close to theoretical while smoothing out transients. It is very easy to run out of storage bandwidth in my experience."

"Well... size matters. The tip of a wind turbine blade moves <i>much</i> faster (~25m&#x2F;s, up to 80m&#x2F;s in the biggest ones) than the tip of a silent computer fan (~5-6m&#x2F;s, up to ~10m&#x2F;s in the faster ones). You can make the blades more silent but there&#x27;s a limit to what you can do when your blades move that fast and are up to 75m long. And any solution that reduces efficiency is probably a no go for manufacturers and operators.<p>From your links you can see that a 140mm computer fan at 1000RPM is noisier than a 120mm fan at 1200RPM. Even if the motor is quieter at the lower RPM, increasing the blade size is more than able to compensate and make it overall noisier, even with dimples and owl-wing tricks.<p>And it&#x27;s not only the decibels that are the issue necessarily but also the frequencies which can propagate quite far and by all accounts are pretty disturbing. That low frequency hum that the blades produce by simply displacing air while they move is not a problem with a computer fan&#x27;s tiny blades. And turbines come in farms."

"&gt; this would allow low-bandwidth applications to be prioritized.<p>That is a completely different kind of &quot;prioritization&quot; than what we are talking about here, though.<p>In particular, this &quot;prioritization of low-bandwidth applications&quot; does not in any way need to be aware of applications. All you need to do is to do fair link scheduling over all customers on a given link with some sort of token bucket per customer that allows short bursting. That way, if there is a customer that&#x27;s been idle for a few minutes, say, they&#x27;ll be able to transfer at, say, ten times the fair average rate for a few seconds, while other customers are slowed down proportionally, thus providing them with low latency. But that does not imply a higher average rate, nor a distinction of video vs. non-video, or anything like that. On average, every customer on a congested link would still be getting the exact same bandwidth, just as a constant low-bandwidth stream for some and as a series of short, fast bursts for others.<p>What tcxgy is arguing for is that if you are streaming video (or whatever other application that he doesn&#x27;t like), then you should only be getting 2% of the average bandwidth compared to someone who is using an application he approves of. So, if you are constantly posting high-resolution pictures (something that he seems to approve of) at an average of 50 kB&#x2F;s, that should get 50 kB&#x2F;s, but if you are watching a 25 kB&#x2F;s video stream of some sort, that should be throttled to 1 kB&#x2F;s, because otherwise it&#x27;s supposedly violating some laws of physics, and it&#x27;s abusive to use half the bandwidth for video, and whatever other nonsense arguments he has come up with so far."

The way to &quot;better represent&quot; minority groups is to have different weightings to those groups. But then that&#x27;s difficult because you have to specify which groups are more equal than others. Clearly we like racial minorities and don&#x27;t like minority groups like white nationalists (at least as a public), but most lines aren&#x27;t this easy to differentiate.<p>The goal of voting systems like this is not so much to tackle this majority vs minority problem but rather to reduce tribalism. In a first past the post voting style your optimal strategy is not to pick the thing you like the most, but to rather pick the thing that you think is most likely to win and more closely aligns to your beliefs. These voting systems are more about finding common beliefs. For example, republicans and democrats agree on many issues. These systems are about anti-polarization, not about weighted representation."

If you live in an urban area, your entire walk to the bar is likely on camera, the bar has cameras, your cab ride home has cameras, the transit bus has multiple cameras, the transit station has cameras, if you live in a high rise it likely has cameras, in a suburb atleast one of your neighbors have cameras. Most all of these cameras are now connected to internet enabled DVRs with questionable at best security. This is reality now. Privacy seems to be on it&#x27;s last legs."

"&gt; I suspect you would bottleneck on the PCIe bus before you saw improvement.<p>Heh, you&#x27;re right. Its not even close. PCIe x16 is slightly less than 16GB&#x2F;s.

So literally, it is slower to transfer the data to the GPU than to use those AVX2 instructions.<p>Heck, its slower on the one-way trip to the GPU, before it even comes back (and before the GPU even touches the data!)"

"Just to be clear, the issue with relativity you&#x27;re having is not particularly related to Special or General relativity - but classic relativity.<p>&gt; What about objects in a plane, where one moves but never intersects the other<p>Just imagine standing next to the highway - the cars are not driving directly at you - but you can still tell they&#x27;re going fast. You know where they are relative to you, and how that value changes over time, which gives you velocity. If I sprint next to the cars, they increase or decrease in speed relative to me of course. They don&#x27;t change speed relative to Earth, which makes it easier to be a little objective about their speeds.<p>Think of it this way. In the black void of space. No stars, no nothing. There&#x27;s me and you. We&#x27;re 20 feet apart, but getting closer together at a constant rate. From my perspective, you&#x27;re getting closer to me. From your perspective, I&#x27;m getting closer to you. Both of us can effectively measure each others speeds. Even if we&#x27;re not parallel - if we&#x27;re perpendicular, it&#x27;ll still be similar.<p>What may be tripping you up is rotation. If I spin in circles, is that the same as everything else spinning in circles around me? If I were to go to a parking lot and spin around quickly, like a ballerina - what&#x27;s happening to the cars? Well, one second, there&#x27;s a car 50 feet behind me, the next second, it&#x27;s 50 feet in front of me! You might think it just traveled 100ft per second relative to me! But this isn&#x27;t the case. We can determine who is rotating and who is not, even in our black void. Rotation is not relative, it is absolute.<p>Take our black void example again. Except this time, we&#x27;re both still, but you&#x27;re spinning. From your perspective you see me floating 10 feet away from you, quickly orbiting you. You might think this is a relative situation - are you spinning, or am I rapidly orbiting you? But it is in fact, objectively true that one of us is spinning and the other isn&#x27;t. How can you tell? Well, a number of ways.<p>For starters, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for me to be orbiting you. There&#x27;s no gravity at play, we could measure and feel that if it were the case. So if this illusion is to work, I must be zipping around you on my own accord, using my own energy somehow - like a little jetpack. But even still! Even with that ambiguity, you could tell you were rotating.<p>You can feel it in your arms, for one! Centripetal force will cause your arms to fly out, the faster you spin. Contrast this with floating in a straight line in our void. You could be flying by at 1000m&#x2F;s or crawling at .1m&#x2F;s and not know the difference without a reference point. Rotation, you can always figure out without a reference point. Rotation is absolute."

"PCIe3 x16, current generation has a bandwidth of 15.75 GB&#x2F;s (×16)<p>Assuming you have 16 GB or RAM on the GPU, theoretically ~1 second is all it would take to load the GPU with that amount of data.

Those would also require at least 5 PCIe 2x8 ports on a pretty performant setup. RAM bandwidth is assumed to be around ~40-60GB&#x2F;s, so hopefully no bottlenecks there.<p>This is assuming your GPU could swizzle through 16GB of data in a second. They have a theoretical memory bandwidth of between 450-970 GB&#x2F;s.<p>Now realistically, per vendor marketing manuals, the fastest DB I&#x27;ve seen allows one to ingest at 3TB &#x2F; hour ~~ 1GB &#x2F; second.<p>So there must be more to it than the theoretically 16GB &#x2F; second business.

"All and all a good intro tutorial that gets into some of the common professional use cases.  On &quot;constant bitrate&quot; assumptions and some of the subsequent discussion here, ANY transform-and-entropy codec like VP9 or H264 will ALWAYS be variable bitrate internally.  In the pro broadcast world, where you can&#x27;t go over your FCC-allocated radio frequency bandwidth allocation by even one iota (or nastygrams and fines ensue), this is &quot;handled&quot; by actually having the encoder understoot the actual target (say it&#x27;s 5mbit), and then the stream is padded with null packets to get a nice even 5mbit&#x2F;s.  This also happens with LTE broadcast as well.  The encoders that do this reliably are fabulously expensive and of a rackmount flavor."

So that&#x27;s 5m, to move 5m between frames at 30Hz you&#x27;d need to be doing about 300 mph.

"Yes, completely sure. Corner reflectors are used to calibrate SARs by providing fixed bright ground points. I&#x27;ve also seen SAR imagery where unintentional corner reflectors (in this case, a building) completely washed out the image at that location.<p>It&#x27;s true that the SAR antenna has moved a little bit by the time the transmitted signal is received. However, the signal is moving significantly faster than the satellite - with a 600km orbit, velocity is ~8km&#x2F;s - so the roundtrip time is maybe 0.04s, meaning the satellite has moved 320m. That&#x27;s about 0.2 degrees from the point of view of the reflector.<p>The synthetic aperture is not just the distance covered in the round trip of a single chirp, but the distance covered during the imaging process. A SAR typically produces chirps constantly (in the tens to hundreds of Hz) and digitises the responses. All of the energy of all those responses can then be combined to form the image.<p>If the corner reflector is in a fixed location, every chirp will have a spike in the response corresponding to that location."

"I found most large companies who use cloud at scale have a team&#x2F;s managing cloud, providing tooling around management and deployment or even full on PaaS solutions on top of providers. So you might not have you traditional sysadmins but you have a team of what recruiters like to call devops engineers instead.<p>The main advantage of cloud is the flexibility, treat resources as ephemeral, being able to click a button and get more&#x2F;less resources. You don’t need to wait for a server to ship and be installed in a dc, if you don’t know what specs you need just twiddle the dials until you get something that performs as you want. It allows you to deploy &#x2F; release quicker and easier.<p>It’s possible to architect so the cloud is cheaper but almost never happens. Optimising is intensive, often it’s called over engineering by pm’s&#x2F;product owners. Costs normally start out low, blow up as products ramp out feature after feature and teams start onboarding, if performance is an issue it’s easier to increase an instance size instead of profile and change architecture. Only when the person paying the bill says this is to much does architecture and other optimisations happen, sometimes at a point when it’s hard to retrofit."

"they are turbine generators in hydro electric power plants - they are live buildings; the floor and walls are resisting all of the torque from the generators and the forces exerted by the water flowing through the building, and the machines are vibrating at 1 mm&#x2F;s velocity or about 4&#x2F;1000&quot; displacement. So it isn&#x27;t completely stationary, everything is just kind of humming and rumbling - unless there is a short circuit out on the power system and then massive forces are exerted on the generator and power conductors, or if the machine becomes disconnected from the power system and has 10 MW coming in and 0 MW going out it tends to speed up quite rapidly and shake a bit more - but for the most part I can&#x27;t imagine any conductors wearing through their insulation, ever. No wires are ever exposed to sharp edges."

The real world throughput of the internal SSD on the new MacBook Pros at 3GB&#x2F;s will be 6 times faster than SATA III.

"HPC guy here; Nope, we don&#x27;t bother recompiling the kernel for every piece of hardware we have. HPC code tends to run 99.99% in user space, kernel performance doesn&#x27;t matter that much.<p>End user applications, that&#x27;s another matter, and here using all the latest vector instructions etc. can make a difference. Usually less so than what one might hope, though. The really big deal tends to be using optimized libraries such as OpenBLAS, FFTW, MKL instead of doing numerical linear algebra yourself in a naive fashion, or using the reference netlib BLAS.<p>Another very common problem we see is poor application I&#x2F;O patterns. Yes, every HPC site loves to brag how many GB&#x2F;s their Lustre system does, but if you divide that by the number of CPU cores in a cluster, that ratio is quite low. Additionally, like other clustered file systems, Lustre metadata performance is relatively poor, so applications banging on lots of small files can easily tank the performance of the entire Lustre system."

I&#x27;m not saying that your bullshit detector isn&#x27;t justified, but that is a fairly self-explanatory claim (well, the &quot;how&quot; part anyway, numbers are lacking).<p>When you have an input flow, and the cross-sectional area is decreased, the speed has to pick up to compensate.<p>For example, if you have a fluid flowing through a 2ft-radius tube at 10 cubic feet&#x2F;second, just divide the volumetric flow rate by the area to get a velocity of 5&#x2F;(2π) ft&#x2F;s.  If later in the tube, the radius decreases to 1ft, that reduces the cross-sectional area by a factor of 4.  But, 10 ft³&#x2F;s is still being pushed in, so that&#x27;s what needs to come out.

"Once parallel execution became part of every design discussion that had a performance concern, the vast majority of programmers stopped caring (and consequently talking) about compilers. Who cares if you can do 36k requests&#x2F;s to my 18k if I can do 36k across 2 or 3 machines? I pass that on to the customer. Why try to hire for or wait around for an optimization trick to double performance (that will likely never be realized or discovered) when there&#x27;s business to be done? The post-optimization is pure profit and can be quantified, so might as well wait and let some specialist (who does care about compilers) handle it if the product ends up being valuable enough to hire them. This is how development and hiring works today.<p>&gt; At some point in history, people stopped worrying about not understanding compilers<p>&gt; This part is misleading too<p>Not in the least. Interpreting that to mean &quot;all people stopped worrying&quot; is deliberate misinterpretation."

"There&#x27;s a fundamental difference between shareware &#x2F; free trial apps and apps that require constant in-app purchases to... well... play.  Doom and others use the free trial model, which is what we used to call shareware (before the internet, they wanted people to share the free trial with each other to inspire them to then go buy the full version).  As long as these are properly listed as such, there&#x27;s nothing sleazy about them at all.  And it&#x27;s fine to use an in-app purchase to go from trial to full version.  Again, as long as its clear to the user that this is the way it works.<p>Games that have in-app purchases run the spectrum.  Some use in-app purchases to do customizations and other fun things that don&#x27;t affect gameplay.  Then there are those like Dungeon Keeper which are basically unplayable without in-app purchases.  Watch the video I linked above for details on why.  You have to pay over and over and over just to keep the game playable.<p>This is very different from a shareware&#x2F;free trial model.  You pay ONE TIME and you own the whole game.  It&#x27;s a classic commercial game scenario except they give you a taste of it... a trial... for free.  It&#x27;s the same thing with &#x27;lite&#x27; versions of commercial software that are also free.<p>The in-app purchasing model is more akin to getting a free version of an FTP client that only allowed you to upload software at 10KB&#x2F;s.  You can then pay $0.99 to upload that one file at full speed.  But, your very next upload would again be 10KB&#x2F;s unless you also paid $0.99 to upload that one at full speed.  But wait, for an even better value, you can buy a 20-pack of full-speed uploads for only $9.99 or a 100-pack of full-speed uploads for only $29.99.  Once those run out, of course, you&#x27;re back to 10KB&#x2F;s.  Unless you spend even more money.<p>Now, it seems silly with the FTP client example above.  Who would ever use that software?  But this is exactly how many of the free to play games work.  And this is the way a lot of people coming in to gaming for the first time think games work."

"The Ars data is from mid to late 2015 which not much has changed from due to ISPs stance and their spending on legislature bribes&#x2F;lobby instead of on their networks. Costs have gone up but not speeds or availability. Cord cutting also increased rapidly the last couple years, so ISPs stopped expanding to increase revenues from data caps, overages and forcing people to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; to worse service to make up the revs.<p>Nothing has changed on ISP infrastructure&#x2F;improvements since late &#x27;15&#x2F;&#x27;16 other than maintenance. I see no sources on your point that it has changed and locally here just data caps have been added, no speed improvements or innovation. ISPs just worked with the FCC to LOWER the number that is rated &#x27;broadband&#x27; to 10Mbps as broadband in their description. 10 Mbps is not acceptable for a more than a single person, 25-100 is barely acceptable -- everyone should be on gigabit -- lots of false 12Mbps competition which does not compare to 25&#x2F;100 Mbps. ISPs have not expanded their networks enough at all <i>by their own admission as they said NN was preventing that supposedly</i> eventhough we know it is cord cutters cutting into investment because ISPs&#x2F;providers got greedy.<p>2015-present the ISPs stopped expanding after Google Fiber pulled out of markets and they were being bratty about net neutrality passing, they put all their money in lobbying. They literally said in their lobbying that NN has hindered investment and did little &#x27;16-&#x27;18 just to stick to that talking point until their paid off lawmen killed NN.<p>Of course, now that net neutrality is gone, what they said was &#x27;holding up&#x27; investment in their networks, I am <i>sure they will be expanding at a rapid clip and we&#x27;ll all have gigabit internet soon now right</i>? &#x2F;s"

You&#x27;re completely ignoring the difficulty mechanism in Bitcoin. When everyone has a 1TH&#x2F;s miner that consumes 1kWh and suddenly a 10TH&#x2F;s miner that consumes 1kWh comes out everyone is going to switch to the new miner. Because Bitcoin guarantees that a block is mined every 10 minutes it has to make the calculation 10x harder than before. The end result? The energy consumption didn&#x27;t change.<p>What makes Bitcoin more energy intensive then? The price of Bitcoin. When the price of Bitcoin doubles that also means the mining profit doubles. More miners (= more energy consumption) join the blockchain until the profit margin is back to the previous level. The price of a Bitcoin is 70x higher than the price of Ethereum so that suggests that Bitcoin should use 70x more energy.

However, these days I&#x27;d say the bandwidth of good Internet connections is high enough compared to typical single-digit-MB PDF sizes that relatively large amounts of junk shouldn&#x27;t inconvenience users too much; I just tested and got ~2.2MB&#x2F;s from Cryptome, which is not terribly high, but definitely high enough that, say, doubling a 5MB PDF to 10MB would be no big deal.<p>For the user, anyway.

"I don&#x27;t think that is the right way to think about it, it has more to do with trajectory bending. For example, let&#x27;s say an object is going radially outwards away from the sun at 10 km&#x2F;s when it encounters a planet that is orbiting at 30 km&#x2F;s.<p>Let&#x27;s say the trajectories are at right angles, so their relative speed difference before the encounter is 31.6 km&#x2F;s.<p>I now claim that this relative speed difference is the same before and after the encounter, so there&#x27;s no &quot;less time spent decelerating on the way out&quot;. (This is an approximation, I&#x27;m pretending that the planet provides an inertial reference frame with conservation of energy. The centripetal&#x2F;sunward acceleration is small enough for that.) Let me show how you can still get a gravity assist under this assumption.<p>If the object passes &quot;in front&quot; of the planet in such a way that its trajectory gets bent towards the retrogade direction of the planet, then its speed becomes 30 - 31.6 = -1.6 km&#x2F;s. So 1.6 km&#x2F;s relative to the sun, and direction retrograde of the planet.<p>If the object passes &quot;behind&quot; the planet in such a way that its trajectory gets bent towards the prograde direction of the planet, then its speed becomes 30 + 31.6 = 30 + 31.6 = 61.6 km&#x2F;s relative to the sun, this time in the prograde direction of the planet.<p>I hope I&#x27;ve convinced you that gravity assists work by taking the relative speed difference, and reorienting it."

"You are looking back at the past with rosy goggles.<p>What I remember from the time was how you couldn’t run that many things simultaneously. Back when the Pentium II was first released, I even had to close applications, not because the computer ran out of RAM, but because the TCP&#x2F;IP stack that came with Windows 95 didn’t allow very many simultaneous connections. My web browser and my chat were causing each other to error out.<p>AJAX was not around until late in the Pentium II lifecycle. Web pages were slow, with their need for full refreshes every time (fast static pages an anomaly then as now), and browsers’ network interaction was annoyingly limited. Google Maps was the application that showed us what AJAX really could do, years after the Pentium II was discontinued.<p>Also, video really sucked back in the day. A Pentium II could barely process DVD-resolution MPEG-2 in realtime. Internet connections generally were not the several Mbit&#x2F;s necessary to get DVD quality with an MPEG-2 codec. Increasing resolution increases the processing power geometrically. Being able to Zoom call and see up to 16 live video feeds simultaneously is an amazing advance in technology.<p>I am also annoyed at the resource consumption, but not surprised. Even something “native” like Qt doesn’t seem to be using the actual OS-provided widgets, only imitating them. I figure it’s just the burden we have to pay for other conveniences. Like how efficient supply lines means consumer toilet paper shortages while the suppliers of office toilet sit on unsold inventory."

"I have written several thousand review articles over the last dozen years or so. Reviews of (in descending order) comics, books, films and albums, for diverse print and digital media. It is possible that those who approached you sincerely would like your take specifically. That does happen, but more often, I have found, is the case of reviewing being a cheap effort at adcopy.<p>Honestly, I feel that aside from family and friends of those responsible for the source work, reviews generally go unread by the bulk of the masses. I really think most PR persons are incredibly lazy, and instead of making efforts to think outside of boxes, rely heavily on the old standbys of reviews, interviews, and press releases (ready for copy and pasting among the blogging elite). If the creator responsible is not &quot;a name&quot;, then PR persons are compelled to get someone, anyone, to view the work. And then, more often than not, the PR persons pray that such person will do the selling for them.<p>I realize this sounds bitter. (I&#x27;ve spent far more efforts on promoting indie creators than I have on developing my own works, to very mixed results.) But ultimately, composing review articles is essentially unpaid adcopy work. I think a strong review should be handled along the lines of a high school book report. The habit can be a neat exercise unto itself, as far as writing in general. But there are many snakes in the grass.<p>All said, if the work&#x2F;s in question truly strike you (for good or ill), then by all means have a go at formulating your opinion on the matter for others. If only for the sake of trying something new. But be weary of getting locked into it. You do one review, then the publisher or producer may well send you another soon enough. And as I am fond of saying, inundation only suits dry fields."

"It is intriguing, and we have one D700 Mac Pro for test purposes. At the time we ordered the Pros for the prototype rack that is the subject of this article, we found that other parts of our pipeline were preventing us from taking full advantage of the increased GPU performance.

"Both Google and FB (from what I understand) have a ton of tricks to help this, but I expect Yann was speaking generally even with all these tricks, and he is right from what I have seen. The old paper on DistBelief talks about topping out at ~80 machines due to network overhead - it would be great if they talk more about distributed TF in an upcoming paper.<p>If TF really has a way to make general, networked, distributed training efficient (more than 1 bit weight updates, low precision weights and all the other crazy tricks which already exist) - that is truly remarkable and they rightly deserve huge kudos.<p>If they are faster in distributed training only on Google machines or with Google&#x27;s network architecture, that isn&#x27;t really a useful datapoint for the general public.<p>We could wire everything with 10GB&#x2F;s NiCs, change to jumbo frames, pull all these other bandwidth reducing tricks, trick out the Linux kernel, etc. and then your network probably won&#x27;t matter - but that isn&#x27;t really general or cheap. The key will be what is the <i>minimum effort</i> necessary to avoid network bottlenecking, and does TF improve that minimum level over existing solutions?"

"&gt; The API is actually Open Source, Apache 2.0 to be precise, that&#x27;s how AppScale could get started implementing the App Engine model.

No way to lock dependency versions, even if I fork something and depend on it, nested dependencies can fuck up at some point. We need something like NPM to manage our dependencies in a sane way.

"Here&#x27;s an option you might not have considered, but might be applicable, depending on the read&#x2F;write speeds you need from those hundreds of gigabytes of data. Amazon has cloud drive, which costs something like 50 bucks a year, and has unlimited storage.<p>The neat thing is someone created a FUSE file system called acd_cli that allows you to use the cloud drive as if it were a normal hard drive. The speeds aren&#x27;t too shabby either; I easily get 150MB&#x2F;s up and down on my dedicated server, and response times are snappy. Additionally, you can create a unionfs mount so that writes are instant, and you sync new files on a regular schedule.<p>Of course, that might not be applicable to your use case, but I use mine for many things.

"Employee Stock Options Programs (ESOPs) are the way most conduct this transaction.

I think the m&#x2F;s terminology is not technically correct.<p>The actual behavior of a &quot;slave&quot; would better be described as a &quot;follower&quot; or a &quot;replica&quot;.

"The price does matter. Keeping a network with 250 PHash&#x2F;s running costs 219 million Dollars per year (1 GHash&#x2F;J mining efficiency, 100 $&#x2F;MWh energy costs) and probably quite a bit more if you account for other costs like hardware, rental or cooling. If your block reward is worth nothing you will have a problem keeping the network running. Scale back the hash rate and you get vulnerable. Increase the fees - with 100k transaction per day you are looking at costs of 6 Dollars per transaction for electricity only - and you damage one of the main selling points of Bitcoin, cheap transactions. And this again is prohibitive for Bitcoin adoption in underdeveloped countries which are often suggested as a core market."

The person whose video garnered the most votes would win a new 20 GS&#x2F;s oscilloscope with a bandwidth spec of 6 GHz and a price tag in the neighborhood of US $70,000.<p>Naturally, the winner turned out to be a kid who made a video about an electric water heater and got a bunch of her schoolmates to flood the voting page.  The highest-ranked entry by someone with a legitimate need for a 6 GHz oscilloscope finished in a distant third place.<p>So Keysight did the only thing that could have avoided a giant online dumpster fire, and gave one of the scopes to each of the top three contestants.

Let&#x27;s take that same 48mbit&#x2F;s, but adjust for 60fps instead. 1 frame would therefore be 0.8 mbit, or 100KB. If your network can do 48mbit&#x2F;s, your video latency would therefore be 16ms. If your network is faster, though, the latency drops proportionally. Even a cell phone can do 100mbit&#x2F;s on wifi, which would be 8ms of latency. A gigabit network would transfer that 0.8mbit needed in about a millisecond.<p>So your total latency of input, encoding, and transmission of the frame would be 32ms at most, and if you have a fast network &amp; computer it could actually be down in the 5ms or less range."
"The moment the ant takes even one step, the far end will no longer be move away from the ant at 1 km&#x2F;s, so it will be able to move fast enough to catch up and cross the rope.<p>After one step, the ant will be somewhere in the middle, and both ends will be moving away from it.  (Because when the rope stretches, every point on the rope moves away from every other point on the rope.)  If the far end is moving one direction, and the near end is moving the other direction, and the two ends are moving away from each other at 1 km&#x2F;s, then neither of them can be moving away from the ant at 1 km&#x2F;s.  The ant will then be able to catch up with either end."

"Mining the surface is required; importing any significant quantity of material from Earth is a non-starter. Unless you can come up with something insanely valuable to export to Earth, any planetary colony has to be almost-entirely self-sufficient. Interplanetary transit is too long, and too expensive. (This is true on Mars as well, and probably Luna and asteroids as well, though you might find some edge cases there due to lesser gravity or greater proximity.)<p>The pressure on the surface is that of about 3000 feet of water, so that&#x27;s not too bad, and the reducing atmosphere can be handled, but the temperature is tough. Still, with practice, you could probably build such machines. Dunno how you make electronics survive long term at ambient 465 °C (oil wells have a hard time with electronics at much lower temps) but some combination of active cooling, limited duration, and novel fabrication should be possible.<p>Perhaps the easiest solution is to load up your Venus Mining Hopper with a whole bunch of liquid nitrogen, extracted from the atmosphere and compressed and liquefied using solar power falling on your floating platform. It deflates its balloon and drops to the surface, and starts scooping up material into its hopper as the LN2 boils off, cooling the electronics and other temp-sensitive systems. (These are buried in lots of insulation.) When the hopper is close to full, you start venting the N2 into the balloon, and the whole system takes off again, to rendezvous with a solar-powered tug to pull it to your ore-processing factory. That may be a long haul, because the upper atmosphere of Venus moves at 100m&#x2F;s. Maybe you design your system to stay on the ground long enough for the platform to come back around the planet, a mere 4-5 days. Or maybe it just takes a big bite and goes straight back up so it doesn&#x27;t get too far behind.<p>So maybe doable, but it makes the hurdle for setting up a self-sustaining colony much higher. Not that it&#x27;s a much lower hurdle anywhere else."

"Humio looks interesting but it appears to be a linear search approach. This is fine as I commented elsewhere and their numbers match what I was able to achieve with my linear based prototypes.<p>The reason I rejected this approach is it gets very expensive for large data volumes if you want your queries to remain responsive.<p>Say you want to search a 100 TB dataset (not as large as it sounds when it comes to log data...). You can do about 1GB&#x2F;s&#x2F;core assuming you have the data on local disks that can scan fast enough and each of your machines have 16 cores that is 16GB&#x2F;s&#x2F;machine. Lets say your query target time is 60s (pretty slow tbh, incredibly generous I would say).<p>The math then plays out like this. You can scan 60*16GB for each node in your cluster, i.e 960GB. You need to have that ~TB of data on disks that can read at 16GB&#x2F;s which means you need it evenly spread across 8-16 very high end SSDs.<p>On top of that you need 100 of these machines to complete this query in 60 seconds.<p>Now Humio goes on to say you can store all your persistent data in a cloud bucket. Which is a good strategy and something I am employing too but if you have no indices you actually need to scan it all which means you are limited by how fast you can reasonably fetch the objects across your cluster and hence the speed of your network interfaces.<p>Say if you are on GCP which has a relatively fast network that seems capable of around 25Gbit to GCS most of the time and you actually get peak performance all the time (pretty unrealistic but ok). Then to fully scan 100TB in 60s you would need over 500 machines. If you are able to use Humios tags to reduce this somewhat say by only searching for errors and that gets you down to 10% of your total logs that would represent a 90% speedup. Humio sort of has quasi indexing in this way similar to Prometheus however they don&#x27;t help you when what you are looking for isn&#x27;t tagged to stand out.<p>This is why indices. Yes - indices are hard, yes they can have bad worst cases if you aren&#x27;t super careful. However lets consider indices for this query.<p>Say your logs are syslog + some extra structured data. You have things like application_name, facility, level, etc.
You have 100TB of logs to search, you are looking for logs by your main application which is say 60% of your total log volume, you are looking for DNS resolutions errors that contain a specific string &quot;error resolving&quot;.<p>With my prototype my indices are approximately 5% the size of the ingested data. The raw ingested data is also compressed really highly, lets assume equal to Humio (it&#x27;s probably higher due to file format but not important).<p>So the thing that jumps out here is we now only need 5TB of indices on our machines to reasonably find needles in our 100TB of data. Additionally our indices are split by field so if we know we are searching the message field we only need to load those. Indices for columns with low cardinality are extremely small, those for high cardinality much larger but capped due to various log specific optimisations I am able to use. So lets assume the message field makes up the majority of our index, say 80%. That brings us to 4TB of data we need to scan.<p>Now usually 60s would be super slow for a query for a system with indices like this, usually you would try make sure that 4TB is in RAM and simply blow through it in &lt;1s across a few machines. However for comparisons sake lets say 60s is still our query budget and we don&#x27;t have completely stupid amounts of RAM.<p>So we need to be able to scan 4TB&#x2F;60s ~= 66GB&#x2F;s which given our previous machine calcs with local storage puts us at ~5 machines.<p>However we could likely do this with even less CPU assuming our storage is fast enough as unlike an unindexed system like Humio we aren&#x27;t applying expensive search algorithms to every row, we are simply crunching a ton of bitset operations in this case a metric ton of bitwise AND.<p>Anyway this is a long rant. The reason why is that many people always say &quot;Can&#x27;t you just do this fast enough with linear search&quot; and I always have to reply &quot;it depends on how big the haystack is&quot;. This quantifies what is too big of a haystack in a reasonable way."

"You got me thinking about what other factors could affect the result at various degrees of precision. By my math [1], the time it takes for the sound of the starting buzzer to reach the ears of swimmers at opposite ends of the pool could actually affect the outcome measured in hundredths of a second. But it&#x27;s an order of magnitude smaller effect than the lane lengths varying by 3cm. Of course, they could remedy this (and for all I know, maybe they do!) by having one starting buzzer speaker placed at the same distance behind each swimmer.<p>[1] Each lane is 2.13m wide, so the swimmers in lanes #1 and #8 are 14.91m apart. If the buzzer were placed right next to swimmer 1, it would take ~0.044s longer to reach swimmer 8&#x27;s ear (using 340.29 m&#x2F;s as the speed of sound). Or if it were right in the middle between swimmers 4 &amp; 5, it would reach swimmers 4 &amp; 5 ~0.019s before it reached 1 &amp; 8."

"Rust, Golang and Nim are safer than C++. Sorry that I didn&#x27;t express it clearly enough; I considered the safety issues to be rather obvious.<p>&gt; Rust I understand provides some nice semantics for thread safety but these exist in Java as world.<p>How do you get Java to fail compiling if thread safety constraints are not met? I&#x27;d be interested to try it out!<p>One should definitely care about cache hit rate, because it significantly affects runtime performance. There are just 512 L1D cache lines per CPU core.<p>I&#x2F;O is the bottleneck? It is becoming less so, one of the few areas where there&#x27;s actually some nice progress happening. PCIe SSDs are up to 1.5 - 2 GB&#x2F;s (=up to 20 Gbps). More and more servers have 10 Gbps or 40 Gbps networking.<p>Sure, Java is faster when it can use JIT to prune excessive if-jungle, aggressively simplify and inline and adapt to running CPU. But memory layout control is where Java is rather weak. The problem is getting only worse, because the gap between CPU and memory performance is only widening year by year. Memory bandwidth is increasing slowly and latency hasn&#x27;t improved for a decade.<p>C++ is going to be always faster especially if specialized to certain machine and use case. C++ is also going to win by a large margin when there&#x27;s auto-vectorizable code or heavy use of SIMD-intrinsics. 10x is not unusual, if the problem maps well to AVX2 instruction set."

"Speaking from memory as it&#x27;s a little difficult to search for but there&#x27;s no fully FOSS ac driver available for Linux which might be why the BSDs have none, Linux has open source ac drivers of course but they still require proprietary firmware blobs and the performance is terrible compared to the proprietary drivers (think 350Mb&#x2F;s with OpenWrt compared to 800Mb&#x2F;s on stock router firmware).

"Your calculation makes sense. However, for those 20 MB in flight, how much data is stored in buffers?

If you have latency of 0.2 s, then around 2 Gbit of data must be stored in buffers somewhere, making 20 MB in flight only 1% of all data stored in such a ping filesystem."

I do computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for designing, fixing, troubleshooting, and optimizing processes and products. They solve large systems of equations that need many cores for meshing and solving and then we need high CPU&#x2F;GPU core counts just to handle and process the data.

"This has been discussed before but to summarize, it doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>I realize you didn&#x27;t say &quot;into orbit&quot; but it is a reasonable place to start. The disadvantage of &#x27;gun&#x27; type launch systems are that they only get one shot at putting energy into the system and they have to do that at low altitude where the air is thickest (the biggest impediment to going fast) as a result your space craft leaves the gun and goes into the soup of the atmosphere and burns up[1]. This is a problem with the rail gun as well as hypersonic projectiles that have active payloads have to deal with friction heating and remain functional at the point where they arrive. The secondary problem is the g-force as a function of the acceleration of going from full stop to 7.9 kM&#x2F;s in say 10 milliseconds. Your basic physics will tell you that is an acceleration of 
80 <i>thousand</i> &#x27;Gs&#x27;. If you are launching a payload you need a container that can not crush its contents. Of course all that air resistance will bleed off energy&#x2F;speed so you actually have to start much faster than 7.9 km&#x2F;s, as much as 10 - 12 km&#x2F;s to &quot;coast&quot; into orbit. Now you&#x27;re over 100,000 Gs to start.<p>[1] This is not unlike shooting a bullet into water (other than water has higher viscosity and the bullet has a lower velocity) but the effect is the same."
"The problem is &quot;PCIe bandwidth&quot; is really bad.  PCIe 3.0x16 is only 16 GB&#x2F;s, which again is less than half of you would get from any old DDR4 memory.  You might as well do that on the CPU then.<p>NVLink is fine as far as it goes... the problem is it&#x27;s a two-party transaction, NVLink still has to be fed <i>by something</i> and that&#x27;s either another GPU or the CPU or something like a SSD via DMA.  With a database type program, the CPU and GPU use-cases are pointless because you could just be doing the search there and returning results directly instead of device-to-device DMA.  And NVMe SSDs are usually limited to PCIe 2.0x4 which is 2 GB&#x2F;s.  Absolute maximum, 16 GB&#x2F;s, same as any other PCIe-attached device.<p>Remember, GPUs aren&#x27;t always used on compute-bound tasks.  There is a very valid use-case for I&#x2F;O bound tasks where you are just using it as a super-cache.  GPU database programs often (but not always) fall into that category.  You are just searching indexes&#x2F;target columns like crazy and throwing the resulting row IDs back over the wall to the CPU."
"Sure, that part was clear.  But the difference between &quot;quite fast&quot; for <i>this application</i> and &quot;dead slow&quot; might be that hundreds of GB&#x2F;s with GDDRx&#x2F;HBM is so much faster than anything else.  Even the M.2 SSD onboard is probably only ~5GB&#x2F;s.  So if the walk pattern is something that is predictable enough by the GPU (usually pretty linear, but some memory features have 2d&#x2F;3d locality), then you could crunch those numbers as fast as the SSD could deliver them.  Now it becomes a question of how much computation&#x2F;kernel time can you spend on a chunk of data?"

"We spend tens-of-billions of dollars each year putting satellites in space. About $6B just putting fuel into LEO to lift things to GEO, so delivering fuel to LEO is a good starting point and I think we can eventually consider doing a suborbital rendezvous with a rocketship already fueled from lunar sources. Lunar gravity is low and there is no atmosphere so it is likely that in the long run the majority of material used in space will come off the moon or asteroids. A coil-gun would only need to reach 2km&#x2F;s to get to an L1 transfer station to process materials into satellites.<p>Seems like we should achieve ISRU with robots before we waste a lot of money to send people."
"Nah, that mostly isn&#x27;t really true.<p>For one, internet service generally is and is accepted to be overbooked. Not to a degree that customers normally notice (well, it sometimes is, but that&#x27;s not really acceptable), but there is no guarantee that the nominal bandwidth is available at all times to all customers, in particular on mobile networks. The burstiness of the traffic of individual users is not really a problem for network capacity planning, as a large enough collection of users will have a much smoother traffic pattern than any given individual. Yes, one user&#x27;s file transfers throughout the day are very bursty. The combined file transfers of a few thousand users are not.<p>What remains is variation throughout the day--but that also affects streaming services. When noone is transferring files, noone is listening to or watching streams either. So with or without zero rating, you still have to build more infrastructure than if the same amount of data were being transferred completely smoothly throughout the month.<p>Also, if your goal were to smooth out traffic, certain file downloads should actually be treated preferentially--namely, file downloads scheduled for late at night. You should give people free podcatcher downloads at night, so people can download stuff to listen to during the day at night, when the network is otherwise idle, to shift load away from the day.<p>But what I think really makes this a bad argument is the fact that this argument in no way is specific to the approach of treating certain service (operators) preferentially. If your goal is to incentivise smooth bandwidth utilization, there is no need to therefore require specific streaming technologies and a contract between the service and the ISP and all that--all you need to do is to say that bandwidth use below 256 kbit&#x2F;s (or whatever the appropriate bandwidth is) is not counted against the cap, that&#x27;s it.<p>You simply put a price on the actual network load that you want to (dis-)incentivize and leave it to customers to decide how to make use of the resources you are selling them. There is no reason why spotify&#x27;s 256 kbit&#x2F;s needs to be treated differently than my own server&#x27;s 256 kbit&#x2F;s in order to price smoother network load cheaper than non-smooth load. If you want to make things more transparent for the customer, provide them with an app that shows them their current data rate, maybe with a switch that enables &quot;safe mode&quot; (i.e. limiting their data rate to what is not counted against the cap, maybe with some token bucket built in to not slow down occasional web page loads).<p>Or, for that matter, if they were actually serious about the smooth load thing, they could create an internet standard that smart phones (or any other devices) could implement that would allow them to mark flows that are to be subjected to low-bandwidth shaping. Then, apps could potentially just request a &quot;cheap, low bandwidth socket&quot;, and the operating system could make sure that on any ISP that supports a category of slow, cheap bandwidth, that socket&#x27;s data transfer would be zero-rated, without any need to sign contracts between service providers and (thousands of) ISPs, without any discrimination against small services or self-hosted stuff.<p>The collateral damage of the approaches that ISPs are taking is unnecessary for reaching those goals, and everything about how they do it tells you that that is fully intentional."

"A Rod at Mach 20 only has four times the energy of a Rod at Mach 10. Not really a game changer (in my first point I used 7km&#x2F;s which is Mach 20.6).<p>The vis-viva equation doesn&#x27;t change what I was saying in my third point. I didn&#x27;t know about it, thanks for pointing to it, but implicitly I applied it. I found a Hohmann calculator online, and I got that the delta v for going from a 400km orbit to a 100km orbit is about 175m&#x2F;s. I plugged that in the rocket equation assuming a decent solid propellant (APCP used in the retrorockets of the descent stage of NASA&#x27;s Curiosity and Spirit, for example, an application similar to the retrorocket needed here) and I got a propellant fraction of 6.7%. Now, at 400km you still have atmospheric drag, and you need a delta v of about 25m&#x2F;s per year to maintain your orbit. If you want to go to 600km, you pay a price in the deorbiting delta v. At any rate, let&#x27;s say the optimal poster that brings you down from space is between 5 and 10% of the mass of the Rod. We can agree to tall this &quot;tiny&quot;. But this will need at least a revolution around the Earth (at 7km&#x2F;s that&#x27;s more than 95 min). The fact that you have plenty of Rods all over the place doesn&#x27;t help you. A perfectly place Rod will still take 95 min to get from LEO to surface.<p>If you want to hit the atmosphere in minutes instead of 1.5 hours, you need to pay a price in delta v, but you don&#x27;t have a problem with the control at hypersonic speeds - we are still in vacuum. Once you hit the atmosphere you need control to hit the target, not to get to the target faster.<p>Now let&#x27;s see what happens if you put a few dozen or hundred in space. What can you do with a single Rod? Sure, you can destroy a civilian building, and that could be a skyscraper and you kill a few thousand civilians. I don&#x27;t think either the US or Russia would adopt such a strategy (North Korea maybe). But in terms of military targets, what good are these? Remember, they are tiny in comparison with nuclear weapons. You can&#x27;t destroy nuclear bunkers, you can&#x27;t acquire mobile targets.<p>If someone could solve the mobile target acquisition problem, these would be really good at killing tanks and armored vehicles. This could be useful, but this is hardly the application the alarmists on the internet have in mind. The typical perceived threat is some type of decapitation strike (alluded by the comment I was answering to). This simply is far from realistic."

"Well, to start, the rest of the world outside the Silicon Valley bubble (including other &quot;startup&quot; hubs) call new companies &quot;small businesses&quot;.<p>There is a very good distinction here. Small business implies that your business is one that HAS to make money. Sure, it&#x27;s not a lot. It may be a side job. But it is a business that has an actual plan from day one to make money.<p>Small businesses are still the backbone of the U.S. and make up for the majority of all employment. Most of them don&#x27;t raise &quot;VC&quot; money, many of them start with a loan, or the wonderful &quot;friends and family&quot; money. When they fail, it is bad. Friends and family may stop talking, property may be repossessed by the bank, etc. The founders who take VC money are usually young and in tech. The risk they take is nothing compared to the people I stated above. It&#x27;s actually hilarious how out of touch the SV &quot;start up&quot; world is with how most businesses are created. I&#x27;d even say that this is a large reason why the failure rate of companies with VC money is so high, it&#x27;s mostly tech, mostly young people who can fail and be standing on their feet regardless, and these kids have never had to make ends meet in respect to running a business.<p>Of course, there is a place for VC money and the type of companies that are created from taking that money. Many businesses would be far too risky to put your house&#x2F;family&#x2F;entire life on the line if it fails. However, I see so many companies that took VC money, moved to SF, hired a bunch of extremely high paid employees, thus have to provide crazy benefits, and their burn rate is now under a year... and they haven&#x27;t made a single dollar yet!! Insane.<p>With the same amount of money they raised, I can start up in Texas, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, etc, hire as I need, have an office with a much lower cost, and increase my run to several years, if not more. The advantages you get from being in SF are easily wiped out when you give a company 2-3+ years to succeed, rather than 6 months - 1 year in SF.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve seen is that these small businesses are usually started with the people that actually have expertise in the field they are in or are more likely trying to solve a problem they themselves have. I think that is important for a founder&#x2F;s. Many founders in the SV world have no clue about what they are doing. They simply have tools (tech), and are looking to put it into whatever they brainstorm. Much of the time, they do not understand the problems they are trying to solve, or are solving problems they aren&#x27;t important. Another reason for the high rate of failure with companies that take VC money."

"GPUs are essentially wide SIMD processors. If cores take different branches that can slow them down dramatically, in the worst case all cores have to execute all branches.<p>The other thing that slows them down is memory access. Caches are small because everything adds up quickly once you multiply it by a few thousand. They are optimized for access patterns typical in graphics, which is mostly sequential or every-x-bytes. The main memory might be GDDR5 or GDDR6, but even the 600GB&#x2F;s memory bandwidth of the RTX 2080TI is quickly used up once you have 8000 threads requesting random bytes from memory.<p>Apart from branching and memory I don&#x27;t think GPUs have many weaknesses. They can save a lot of transistors because they don&#x27;t care about single-core performance. For example instead of doing sophisticated instruction reordering to hide memory latency they just switch to a different set of threads whenever they would otherwise wait for memory. There are some tasks that Intel CPUs have transistors dedicated to like AES or 64bit integers and they do loose some speed on those, but at the same time these things are easy to do in silicon so your CPU loses to ASICs. And even a GPU eventually has enough cores that the software implementation run 4000 times in parallel will beat the CPU by a wide margin again."
"To get a sense of available band-width, old-style TV was 512 x 480 interlaced, so 30 full frames per second, three colours, with about 6 bit resolution per colour, or about 0.5 MB&#x2F;s.

"what my body taught me over the years is that it&#x27;s healthier to subtract rather than add things. more on point to your question, my approach is to defer anything that is applied via &quot;artificial&quot; means to a stage where I&#x27;ve exhausted all other options. (no sugars, no coffee unless just before workout, etc, ...) In your case I&#x27;d eat fresh tofu or more fish or whatever appropriate.

Also to gain weight you need to give yourself enough recovery time between workouts.<p>I did take supplements during the years of extensive training, and I wasn&#x27;t ashamed to pick from the top-shelf price-range (not to boast but to show who silly I was wasting money like I did), but they only had a placebo effect, left a hole in my wallet.

Back then I wanted to have a <i>proper man chest</i>[1] like actors in action movie posters but instead looked like a slightly fit Iggy Pop (picture Iggy Pop doing supplements and a strict routine instead of heroin and orgies ... and you have the image of what I looked like vs what I wanted to look like)<p>Reason for why I stopped take vitamins is that they can never give me the other nutrients and minerals (yes there are extra supplements for that but - who got time for that?). A healthy fresh (even raw) diet doesn&#x27;t just have the vitamins. It has useful fiber and also contain a gazillion other things ... (sure you can get fiber by eating bran at every breakfast - but why torture myself more than during exercise?)<p>Ofc if you like bran don&#x27;t let me put you off, but my point is that most of the health-foods-supplements industry is a con and has profit at their interest and not always our health (pills that don&#x27;t do damage but also don&#x27;t improve anything have always been huge business (e.g. the whole homeopathic profession is built on such cons)<p>[1] doesn&#x27;t Manchester like a perfect name for a moob-bra? &#x2F;s so sorry"

Most GPU miners have moved from bitcoin to litecoin or feathercoin as they use scrypt hashing instead of SHA256 so are resistant to ASIC hardware.  Mining these currencies usually offer an extra 30-50% over mining bitcoin directly and can be sold for bitcoin or USD on various exchanges.<p>As an example for a $300 ATI 7950 card that generates ~600kH&#x2F;s scrypt you will generate $1.33 per day in litecoins vs ~450MH&#x2F;s with SHA256 which currently generates $1.01 per day in bitcoin.<p>With the onslaught of ASIC hardware coming though it&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s going to happen with GPU mining.  As more people move to the other currencies they will become less profitable to mine and could get to the point where they cost more in electricity than they generate in profit.  Definitely bitcoin mining will be at that point by the end of the year for people without ASIC hardware.

"&gt; seeing as it created those ideas (like Mickey Mouse, etc)<p>Mickey Mouse, perhaps[0]. Many other Disney characters and broad ideas were ripped off of public domain work (sometimes it&#x27;s even more complicated, see Winnie the Pooh - the original character was created by someone else and later licensed to Disney, but there certainly was a lot of subsequent controversy about the precise terms of that licensing deal!) with Disney then laying proprietary claims on them, and also lobbying for extended protections on their newly-proprietarized forms.  That&#x27;s a particularly obnoxious form of copyright trolling.<p>[0] Though, in many ways, Mickey Mouse is simply a technically-simplified form (serving the new medium of cartoon animation, which Walt Disney was then experimenting with) of an <i>existing</i> genre of cartoon&#x2F;comic anthropomorphic mice (of which &#x27;Teddy Tail&#x27; is the best-documented representative).  Serendipitously, the changes - although introduced for merely technical reasons - also made the character a lot more popular, for the same reason why ubercheap anime characters from Japan are popular - humans are attracted to simple forms, symmetry and easily-read neotenous traits, and repelled by complexity and artistry.  So Walt Disney had a good intuition to start with, but his creative success was for the <i>most</i> part a matter of serendipity and being in the right place.

"I&#x27;m working at a startup and we&#x27;re starting to use event sourcing and CQRS a lot more in the replatforming of core components of the application with kafka for an event log.<p>Personally, I find these patterns and approaches coupled with sound domain modelling to be perfectly fine. There is some technical overhead for event sourcing so some places we do not use a journal but instead persist current state but we still emit events and do interesting things with those events. CQRS is pretty safe if you&#x27;re investing into event driven architecture across your organization. You don&#x27;t need to use both - one or the other is okay too.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t have designed this system any other way - there are so many opportunities to do interesting things with the event stream that we discover almost daily.<p>Event sourcing is more dangerous and you need to have some really sharp people around to fix issues that come up and make it hum. We have multi-million line logs and I&#x27;ve had to spend some time going through open source libraries and changing implementations for projections from the log that were creating contention and performance issues, as well as modifying how the open source libraries recover to paginate through the events. All in, we can now recover from json in postgres at a rate of 20k events&#x2F;s (although usually we recover from snapshot!) and we can tear through thousands of commands a second in the running system. After these hurdles, everything is contant time or logarithmic so we can handle orders of magnitude growth without any issue. One day we&#x27;ll have to flip our aggregates to have a clean journal. It&#x27;s just life in engineering though - software isn&#x27;t an event, it&#x27;s a process so if you want to get the gains sometimes there are some costs. As long as you are smart about your choices and have a good team, you can make anything work.<p>I&#x27;ll add that the existing stack uses ORMs&#x2F;active record and the performance overhead of all those damn queries is now too expensive so we&#x27;re building some screaming fast Eventsourced and commandsourced apps SPECIFICALLY TO GET AWAY FROM THOSE TRIED AND TESTED CLASSICAL PATTERNS. Mind you, we could make the existing application hum too with some careful analysis - I&#x27;m not saying one is better or worse, just that they are both equally viable with some smart minds around and good decisions being made. DDD is never a bad thing and ES&#x2F;CQRS happen to be a reallly incredible fit in spaces where the domain is central as you end up very easily discovering you can have pure and beautiful domain models when you think in commands and events.<p>I&#x27;ll just leave a caveat that, while I think we&#x27;re having good success with the decisions, we also work in a domain with enough complexity that we get a lot of benefit in how ES acts as a heuristic in our modelling. Doing the same with a shopping cart may be overkill."
Fair enough. But I don&#x27;t think quoting this for logging in the tracing sense is wrong here. He does acknowledge that trace logs are a degenerative form of logs from the perspective of log processing. The only difference being in the semantics of human readable text v&#x2F;s binary logs.

I&#x27;m in Croatia, about 1km from the tower, -70 dBm.
The (ZTE MF286) router has a MTU 1500 and MSS 1300 setting.

When I try to connect in Archlinux using Networkmanager-vpnc I can connect to the German home network.
But I can&#x27;t ssh into any boxes in the German network.
I am able to do that over Croatian DSL without issues.
The adapter&#x27;s MTU is 1500 and the tun0 MTU is 1412.
So this works over DSL but not over TLE.<p>When I change the adapter&#x27;s MTU down to 1420 (reading libreswan&#x27;s site I stumbled upon this value) I can login via ssh and seemingly also use it as it&#x27;s supposed to.
But then other issues arise...

"It&#x27;s not correct. The rocket equation is exponential for delta-v, not for altitude.

It&#x27;s not a simple relationship though (like say the inverse-square law); it&#x27;s related to propellant velocity, which for chemical rockets is in the neighborhood of 4 km&#x2F;s.  Reaching velocities greater than your propellant velocity is where the exponential ramp really starts to take off.<p>And no, it&#x27;s not just mass either. If you have a rocket that sends mass M to velocity V, then double the size of the rocket and it&#x27;ll send mass 2M to velocity V.

"IIRC it&#x27;s about clock speed. Your electrical signals travel at the speed of light. If you have a 4GHz clock the signal travels at 300,000,000 m&#x2F;s. Now one clock cycle is 0.00000000025s, so the light has time to travel 0.075m. That&#x27;s only 7.5cm!

"From what I understand, each instance of an electron app essentially needs its own copy of the electron framework to work (which includes a web renderer, and javascript engine). So we&#x27;re talking at least 50MB per instance, for applications which may have been 10MB if written in a native language. When you start running many applications, it can certainly add up. Users do notice this kind of stuff, they are just too adaptive to bad user experiences.<p>As for downloads, I remember using dialup and only getting one 1MB file per hour.

"Personally I agree completely.  As someone in tech I find it very difficult to ascribe meaning to a meaningless number.  Especially when people &quot;like&quot; things they hate for comedy or irony purposes, or clicked accidentally a few years ago.  Reading online reviews is a case of trying to glean a little truth from something everyone should know is being heavily gamed.  But they don&#x27;t.<p>Amongst the non-tech population there <i>is</i> trust taken from these numbers.  People believe those reviews.  People seem to believe that a lot of likes is indicative of trust.  People used to believe that clicking blue links was good, and so the web used to be a cesspool of adsense sites providing no real information.<p>Sad fact is it works.  Both with the algorithms - more likes gets more random likes from nowhere over time, and with the visitor perceptions.  probably only the non-technical ones.<p>If it&#x27;s on the web it must be true, right?  &#x2F;s"

"POTS still has alot of life left in it. It just hasn&#x27;t seen any investment. Long-term it could handle greater overall capacity given each household has a physically dedicated line to an aggregation point.<p>Phone companies just need to invest in putting the DSL modems closer to the households, say at the neighborhood cabinet rather than the switching station. A literal mile is too far. VDSL2 can do 100Mb&#x2F;s in each direction at 500 meters, and there&#x27;s no bandwidth contention with your neighbor. And VDSL2 is extremely mature, hardly the state of the art. By comparison, at the office I pay $450&#x2F;month for dedicated 100Mb&#x2F;s fiber service from Cogent. And the POTS infrastructure is just about as reliable--which is to say, very reliable.<p>I live in San Francisco, which is already extremely dense. AT&amp;T owns the POTS system, but they refuse to put in the investment. My switching station is almost 2 miles away. I finally got fiber from Sonic.net. They&#x27;re investing in hanging fiber over much of the westerner half of the city at a time when AT&amp;T is hemming and hawing about upgrading their cabinets. And interestingly, my fiber service runs straight to that switching station 2 miles away.<p>The only reason cable dominates is because the phone companies aren&#x27;t interested in competing. AT&amp;T and Verizon own a huge amount of the POTS infrastructure, but are entirely focused on mobile and cable. It&#x27;s a ridiculous state of affairs having so much infrastructure managed by the same oligopoly. When I cancelled Comcast and told them I was only paying $40&#x2F;month for Gigabit fiber there was a long pause--he was absolutely incredulous. Was it a promo price, he asked.

"Unlimited 50 Mbit&#x2F;s is 17,90€&#x2F;mo and 100 Mbit&#x2F;s is 24,90€&#x2F;mo. Of course with unlimited full speed tethering. I found it utterly ridiculous that in US tethering is limited or there are transfer limits. Users easily use 30, 50 or 100 Gbytes &#x2F; mo. Low limits make torrenting and snapschat, music streaming, Youtube and Snapshat really annoying to use. In Finland average users uses over 10 Gbytes&#x2F;mo. You can guess what kind of amounts the top 20% transfers based on Pareto principle.<p>I usually recommend people to buy only one mobile Internet connection.

Keep the data local to the same CPU and it doesn&#x27;t have to go out to main memory yet.<p>Other things you are saying about &#x27;flushing&#x27; the instruction cache, L3 bandwidth numbers and theoretical LUT that make a difference in one scenario and not the other without measuring (even though the whole scenario is made up) just seem like stabs in the dark to argue about vague what-ifs."

"The Fermi Paradox is predicated on the principle that aliens would actually want to come here. I&#x27;m not sure this is a valid assumption.<p>For a hot and fast civilisation like us to exist for serious amounts of time in space, it&#x27;s going to have to adapt to living in space --- because, as you say, it&#x27;s intensely hostile. One of the key adaptations is to stop being hot and fast. If you can live on small energy budgets you&#x27;re way more likely to survive. If you live slowly then travel becomes much easier, as well as costing less.<p>But if you become a cold and slow civilisation, inner solar systems aren&#x27;t going to be very hospitable --- hot, radioactive, space is so bent that travel is enormously difficult, everything&#x27;s at the bottom of cripplingly expensive gravity wells... why bother? The gas giants are rich, but are even more expensive (to get from low orbit around one of the moons of Jupiter to low orbit around another takes about 10 km&#x2F;s. You can launch from  the <i>surface</i> of Earth for that). But further out... the Kuiper and Oort clouds are peaceful, cheap, hospitable, and chock full of light elements with interesting (if slow) chemistry.<p>Estimates of the Oort cloud density predict that there&#x27;ll be a 20km body every 30 light seconds or so, and that there&#x27;s about five Earth masses in Sol&#x27;s Oort cloud alone. And Oort clouds of neighbouring stars overlap...<p>So I&#x27;m expecting any successful civilisation to start colonising the spaces <i>between</i> the stars, rather than the star systems themselves.<p>In this model, our own solar system could already be colonised, and we&#x27;d never know. They&#x27;d probably have noticed our radio transmissions by now, but it may not have occurred to them to answer yet. They may not bother; if we survive long enough to adapt to space, we&#x27;ll be out there soon. Or they may not be able, depending on their energy budget. Or maybe they are, and we just haven&#x27;t noticed. (New Horizons has a 12W transmitter and we would have to be looking in exactly the right direction to spot it. And it&#x27;s way closer than the Oort Cloud.)<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t explain why our hypothetical civilisation has built a hypothetical megastructure around this star. I wouldn&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d want to do that (except for noting in passing that interstellar travel for hot-and-fast creatures like us basically requires a Dyson sphere for the energy requirements).<p>I&#x27;m planning a book.

"&gt; With 8Gb per DRAM die and 2 Gbps speed per pin, we get approximately 256 GB&#x2F;s bandwidth per HBM2 stack.

"Nobody is still using GPUs.  The best GPU on the market is around 1 GH&#x2F;s.  A decent ASIC (the Antminer S7) is at 5,000 GH&#x2F;s, for around the same price as the GPU.  GPUs are now completely negligible as far as mining goes and they have been for multiple years.<p>Residential power is the same thing.  Yes, there are some people who are mining out of their homes (and in the past I was one), but they are completely swamped out by the people harvesting economies of scale who are running datacenter-scale mining operations.  Losing all miners on residential power will not have a meaningful effect on the network hashrate.<p>&gt; the best-situated miners using the &quot;most efficient&quot; hardware is a factor of 6. The halvening would make that 3.<p>At which point it would rise again over time to find its natural economic equilibrium.  So long as it doesn&#x27;t go below one you will not find a huge crash occurring.<p>&gt; That doesn&#x27;t sound like much margin to me.<p>3X over seems like a huge margin to me.  You don&#x27;t see that much margin often in your everyday life.<p>&gt; What if we see another 50% crash in BTC value? That too would take us right down to the edge of failure, right?<p>We have seen huge crashes in the price of Bitcoin before, and what happened is that the network hashrate stopped most of its short term growth, which is fine.  It has occasionally actually gone down as people switched off their miners temporarily.  Certainly never catastrophic.  You can look up nice charts showing the entire history of Bitcoin&#x27;s price, overlaid with network hashrate and mining efficiency -- it&#x27;s interesting.<p>&gt; But the concerns certainly sound legitimate to me, and what you posted honestly seems like apologism.<p>No offense intended, but if you didn&#x27;t even know that GPU mining is years obsoleted, you need to go learn more before attempting to make judgments on what is valid critique and what is apologism.  All the information on hashrates of current mining rigs and power efficiency is out there.  Go spend a few minutes looking them up and running your own calculations rather than arguing from a base of zero information.  You&#x27;re falling victim to arguments that are phrased in a way that is seemingly persuasive, but that fall apart when you actually look at the history of the network hashrate and how it reacts to price changes.<p>Keep in mind that the halvening can be modeled exactly as a doubling of difficulty, which isn&#x27;t that bad, and has occurred many times over short timeframes over the past.  A halvening isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as, say, a collapse by half in the price of Bitcoin (which affects all of your holdings as well, not just your future earnings), and that too has happened several times before.  And a halvening has ALREADY HAPPENED BEFORE, and nothing catastrophic whatsoever happened.  The network didn&#x27;t even blink. You need to have credible arguments as to why the next one will be different from the previous one, and I haven&#x27;t seen a single one.

These are I&#x2F;P frame coders, at least you&#x27;d not want to use B-frames at these speeds as more effort in your P frames yields more ROI. Intel should, as part of QuickSync, also offer such acceleration, but I am not sure how much that encoder can handle.

"&gt; That violates the 3-2-1 backup rule.<p>Ehh? Not really. All of these things we&#x27;re talking about are components of our backup strategy.<p>If I wanted an offsite backup, its just rsync to some cloud provider (like rsync.net) or something. I don&#x27;t do that because I don&#x27;t think my data is worth the recurring cost of that, but its an option.<p>-------<p>My point is that when my solution is 200MB&#x2F;s and on the order of $500 to $1000 for the component ($500 if you build your own NAS, $1000 if you buy premade parts. Assuming 2x 5TB hard drive is just $300 for 5TBs of _mirrored_ storage)...<p>While your proposed component costs $30 per 0.1TB and read&#x2F;writes at a lousy 70MB&#x2F;s... to get the equivalent mirrored setup you need to buy 100 Blu-Rays or roughly $3000 in Blu Ray XLs alone (2 copies of your data across 2-different Blu Rays, for the same redundancy factor as the 2x Hard Drive solution).<p>So I have to raise my eyebrows a little bit. How are you checking that the data doesn&#x27;t degrade? Are you manually checking all of those BluRays you&#x27;ve created for reliability? That&#x27;s a lot of sitting around and inserting &#x2F; removing drives.<p>Its literally cheaper to build a 2nd NAS and stick more hard drives into it, and keep that 2nd NAS offsite somewhere.<p>-------<p>If you&#x27;re gonna hold my feet to the fire over this &quot;2-media&quot; thing, then my 2nd media of choice would be Flash storage before Optical. Because SPEED is king. Speed means you can checksum your data and ensure that your backups are still good. I think Flash is a bit expensive compared to HDD, but based off of these BL-XL disks, I&#x27;m thinking that Flash is actually cheaper than Blu Ray and something like 10,000% faster. (Tapes would be a more ideal 2nd media... but I&#x27;m not &quot;big enough&quot; to make tapes cost-effective).<p>Yes, checksums and scrubbing. If you want to protect against bitrot (in ANY medium), you MUST double-check your backups over time.<p>TEST your backups. Any backup strategy that doesn&#x27;t have a regular testing schedule is null-and-void in my opinion.<p>I seem to think that HDD, then Flash, and MAYBE Tape (if you&#x27;re going really, really big) are the mediums of choice of the modern computer user. I&#x27;m not really seeing where Optical fits in today&#x27;s world. Maybe a future Disk format (with maybe TB-level disks) can make Optical a thing again... but 100GB Blu Rays aren&#x27;t really in the works for the modern user.<p>70MB&#x2F;s is slow. And 100GB is too small per storage unit."
"Really depends on your scale. If you just run half a rack of equipment a lot of these costs are factored in by your housing company.

Where you need someone to watch the monitoring 24h sitting in the DC - just in case. Even if a lot of this stuff is free, it needs to be setup up and managed all the time.<p>Let alone the cost for DDoS mitigation. Thats an easy 300k€ worth of equipment plus lets say 2x40 GBit&#x2F;s links for lets say 40k€ each per link and month. Over the course of two years thats easy 1 million euros, just to handle DDoS.

"&gt; If you are a fan of music, especially guitar-based music like classic rock, there is no substitute for a vinyl record created through a 100% analog mastering process. Analog captures harmonics that digital simply can&#x27;t. Analog mastering also has much wider dynamic range than does digital mastering.<p>Analog mastering doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the dynamic range of digital; a CD with its paltry 16 bit has a noise floor below -90dB.  There are staggeringly few analog mastering setups that can do that.  Move to 20+ bits (i.e. all pro digital mastering setups) and you are getting to the point where an analog setup might be able to maintain the SNR, but would be astronomically expensive.<p>As far as the harmonics, there is little evidence that humans can detect 22kHz+ sound at safe listening levels, and once you talk about 96 samples&#x2F;s most speakers can&#x27;t reproduce anything like the original signal at 40kHz+.

This delta-v gain is nearly negligible.<p>The free-return trajectory, where you keep the command module&#x27;s orbit in the same plane as the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth is more important (Since both the Moon, and the command module orbits at ~1,000 m&#x2F;s - which is the delta-v that you gain, if you eject from lunar orbit, in the opposite direction to the Moon&#x27;s direction of travel.)"

&#x2F;s is missing.<p>There is this misconception that the absence of regulation is bad. But that is not true for sane appropriate rules. Absence of public rules is not a vacuum of rules but a universe where rules are made by the strongest.<p>Also laws do often not prescribe details but empower regulators to manage the details. There may be laws against predatory pricing. There is also case laws against predatory pricing. But markets also evolved and it us extremely costly and time consuming to prosecute monopoly cases based on principles (read up on e.g. the case against IBM way back). It is more efficient to put in place industry specific rules which then can be enforced with much simpler reasoning.

"DSL sucks. I&#x27;m sure our local ATT has lost the vast majority of it&#x27;s DSL users in the past few years because of rollout problems.

The cable company is also offering 100mbit, 200mbit, 500mbit, and 1gbit connections too.

"There are very tight bounds and what you call &quot;unconscionable&quot; I read at first as &quot;unconstitutional&quot;, and on second thought as &quot;unbelievable&quot; which is pretty much the opposite of &quot;unambiguous&quot;, because of &quot;ex falso quot libet&quot; (from false assumptions follow arbitrary consequences). To a degree you are correct of course, a judge has to judge consciously and if a contract is deficient, the contract cannot guide a conscious decision, but only if awareness of the deficiency nullifies the whole contract. If you let a computer program make decisions, thats your conscious decision to do so.<p>The way programmatic code can improve on it by automated tools is burdened with the same level of complexity, if not higher than Natural Language. But Smart Contracts are, as the name implies, intended to be used for small, manageable bits of code. Never mind codes that are too big to handle for a single person, bugs from a single typo for example could still happen. There&#x27;s simply two sides to that. Either strict enforcement is thought to promote improvements in code quality. Or lenient apologies hope to promote amicable values, as far as trust is concerned, e.g. if due diligence also implies to inform whether a likely mistake was intended or not.<p>If the other party knew of the mistake that may be a &quot;Versteckter Einigungsmangel&quot; (covered up, hidden; Agreement; lack of, deficiency - hidden deficiency of agreement). In that sense no smart contract would be enforcable, because the conscious decision is deferred - post hoc ergo propter hoc.<p>The deciding difference is, if there&#x27;s an automatic arbitrage bot for example, and it&#x27;s not aware of the mistake, the creator has no liability to check for mistakes, I suppose. Whereas if exploits are targeted at buggy programs, that&#x27;s a different matter.<p>The deciding factor would be the custom of the trade. Custom comes from costume. So if a foolish script kiddy exploits a huge bank they will suit up and claim higher right from custom. Vice versa, a kid exploited by automatic gambling bots e.g. will be blamed for wearing a suit to big for it&#x27;s size. &#x2F;s"
"<i>in one month, you can expect to earn $20,724.53 dollars</i><p>They were selling the kit for $22,000, so it&#x27;ll take at least 5 weeks for the ROI, probably longer given there will be at least 2 difficulty resets in that time frame.<p>I looked at investing in one but I couldn&#x27;t come up with the funds.  Instead I have pre-orders out for gear due in October.<p><i>If everyone begins doing this, then it will become extremely difficult to mine any Bitcoin without any sort of gear</i><p>This is already the case.

It&#x27;s literally cheaper to buy a bunch of USB sticks that mine at 350MH&#x2F;s for $100 each than to buy a bunch of video cards as the USB sticks are more power efficient.  Even so, depending on the difficulty, those USB sticks could take a year to earn back the 1BTC."
&#x2F;s means sarcasm<p>However I will say there are newer solar panels that I&#x27;ve read about being tested which can theoretically produce power by moon light.

"There&#x27;s not achieving that at 5W when running the benchmark though, more like 18W-20W. I question the obsession with perf&#x2F;watt. It makes sense if you&#x27;re running a data center, or if you need to do &quot;light&quot; work.<p>But almost everyone I know with a laptop spends the majority of the time working with it docked to power, and often a monitor. If you&#x27;re using a laptop for work, and you&#x27;re not running out of a coffee shop, do you want a Zen3 with 32-64Gb RAM, 8-16 cores and an RDNA2 graphics APU at 50W (Rembrandt), or do you want a a device that will play video for 18 hours?<p>Especially for gaming, Apple&#x27;s GPU is still years behind AMD and NVidia. They&#x27;re bragging about 22Gp&#x2F;s fillrate when latest mobile discrete GPUs do 5-10x that.<p>Certainly, they have achieved a lot and are crushing Intel integrated chips at the low end, but there&#x27;s a ton of marketing fluff and special case comparisons going on, and I look forward to seeing a real head-to-head matchup, of say a Zen3 based system against a MacBook on a heavy CPU and GPU  bound benchmark like a triple-AAA title.<p>Years of synthetic benchmarks that exercise giant CPU caches leaves much to be desired."

"&gt; From what I heard, feature films regularly spend $1 mio+ on renting CPU power alone.<p>Renting CPU power is typically an indication that rendering was severely underestimated and a million USD would be an extreme example. That money could buy multiple racks that would be in use for four or five years.<p>&gt; rendering is heavily optimized to not jump around. It&#x27;s the same for AI convolution.<p>I wish that were true, but with the exception of Disney&#x27;s internal renderer only a few small parts of most renderers end up architected for this.  Don&#x27;t forget that most actual production renderers are multiple decades old.<p>&gt; While the inner loop might not fit into a 128 MB cache, it would fit into 512 MB cache. That would cause the memory bandwidth to raise from ~20 GB&#x2F;s to ~500 GB&#x2F;s.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really make sense. Instructions are very small and the data they operate on are very large.  Each core will be doing different things to different data and the total L3 cache will be used by all of them.  I&#x27;m not sure how you are getting these numbers, but they don&#x27;t seem grounded in reality of real software and lots of cores. L3 cache typically has bandwidth in the same order of magnitude as memory, while Intel is claiming to increase that by 3x in the article.<p>&gt; So if memory bandwidth is the limiting factor - and it is for many convolution and rendering workloads - then a 10x speed-up is possible.<p>This is very far from the truth, especially for rendering.  Most renderers hop around him memory to trace rays through acceleration structures, actual geometry, geometry attributes and texture lookups. Also I&#x27;m not sure how 3x the cache bandwidth translates to 10x program speed in any scenario.<p>&gt; Oh and the development tools I&#x27;m referring to is V-Tune &amp; Amplify, i.e. the Intel tools to make sure your loop is using all the tricks to avoid pipeline stalls so that RAM bandwidth becomes the limiting factor.<p>Yes, those exist, but they don&#x27;t have anything to do with the article or cache sizes."

"Well ... laws of physics are being broken by their ships.  They use fusion drives (which don&#x27;t quite exist yet), and in S1, transit between Ceres and Eros on a passenger ship doesn&#x27;t require weeks&#x2F;months.  Transit from earth to Jupiter&#x2F;Saturn systems are achievable in days.<p>Many assumptions are built into this.<p>First, that fusion drives don&#x27;t need much reaction mass.  This is part of the F =(d&#x2F;dt) (m*v) needed for rocket thrust.  The mass you throw away at high velocity (dm&#x2F;dt) has to be sufficient for you to be able to accelerate a several million kg ship to 1-10g.<p>Second, and related to the first, they are not using energy efficient Hohmann transfer orbits.  They are using fast transit orbits to get between sites.  Which means that their engines are continuously operating, first accelerating away from the initial site, finally decelerating towards their destination site.  You still want to orbitally match on the destination, so your delta V isn&#x27;t measured in km&#x2F;s orthogonal to the destination.<p>Third, a fusion reactor will be massive, if for no other reason, due to the shielding you need for the hard x-rays&#x2F;gammas coming off.  Massive in this case doesn&#x27;t mean large, rather having lots of high Z mass (lead and other heavy nuclei elements that have a very high cross section to Xray&#x2F;gammas).  You likely will need several 10s of cm of such material.  Which means you have to accelerate lots of &quot;inert&quot; mass as well as your reaction mass, as well as your ship.<p>I don&#x27;t expect shows&#x2F;movies to get all the physics&#x2F;science right.  I do expect them to at least make an effort to hint at why we should suspend our disbelief in this.  There was a single episode with a side arc on the ships engines.  They let that arc go unfinished, which is a shame, as that was potentially very interesting.  The protagonist in that arc is assumed to be dead, though somehow, he narrated his experience.  The arc was about drive efficiency, and by extension, specific impulse&#x2F;thrust.<p>The other slight physical violation is in the instantaneous communication of the protomolecule infected individuals.  Maybe they have their own EPR pairs they interact with to ensure instantaneous comms.  But its rather hard to exceed C for information transmission as far as we know right now.<p>So ... yeah ... there are some violations that bug me.<p>[edit] fixed spelling errors"

"I&#x27;m with you that copying all of Google&#x27;s data is unlikely. It&#x27;s a serious project for Google itself to significantly move around its own data internally. My point is that very extensive, damaging information could amount to a mere 100TB subset of it and it&#x27;s not implausible that could be copied in a day at 10 gig&#x2F;s. To obvious? How about 100 hosts each pulling 100 meg&#x2F;s? That&#x27;s feasible right now. When you really get down to it the datasets I fear being leaked the most are a lot smaller than that.<p>Most bandwidth is used sending many copies of the same content. Attackers aren&#x27;t going to be interested in downloading the popular video 100 million times, they&#x27;re just going to grab the logs which are nowhere near that size, and although large it&#x27;s not implausible that even the best security teams wouldn&#x27;t notice until it&#x27;s too late.<p>There is no hard rule that the leaks need to come from the same central database either.

With decent preprocessing you can probably cut the data rate by a rather large factor ( I would assume at least 100, since you do not need to store warez or the NYT homepage.) Then to do the opposite estimate, by assuming that the system is CPU bound, one needs hardware to process 120 GB&#x2F;s. With roughly $10M you can then buy a few thousand machines, and your PRISM software needs to handle something like ~50 MB&#x2F;s per machine.

"Interesting article, but the 100GB&#x2F;s does not make sense, i mean that would require a 800Gbit&#x2F;s - 1Tbit&#x2F;s connection per Team ? Uhm no.

"&gt; Hell, the author of this exact blog post has picked 10 seconds in all of his examples. That a FUCKING BAD timeout. It&#x27;s far, FAR too short for many use cases.<p>It isn&#x27;t necessarily. It all depends on the use-case. If most of the operations are finishing in 5ms then the probability of something finishing after 10s are rather low - and timing out and retrying early is probably the way to go.<p>Someone else in this thread recommended setting the timeout to around the P99 time that operations take. I think that&#x27;s a reasonable starting point, even I might move it towards P99.9.<p>I worked (and am still working) on adjusting timeouts for systems doing billions of requests&#x2F;s. One takeaway from that is that the actual value of timeouts is often not too important if you look at one system in isolation. The latency distribution will be rather logarithmic. Most requests might e.g. finish in 20ms. Then you get a P99 at maybe 3 digit ms, and a P99.9 at 10s (example numbers). From there on it will make a minor difference in availability if you now set your actual timeout to 5s or to 120s - it might just be noise along your other error sources.<p>However it makes sense to align the absolute timeout with timeouts of dependencies. E.g. if you have a chain of<p>client -&gt; service A -&gt; service B<p>and service A always times out first, then the client will get an error that service A is broken - but nobody can easily diagnose whether it was service A or service Bs fault. If service B times out first, the client can get an error message that indicates that. Therefore it makes sense if upstream service timeouts are shorter (even if only by a second).<p>In the same model if the client times out first the services actually do only observe the client dropping the connection. They don&#x27;t know whether the client timed out or cancelled the operation for other reasons. And therefore they might also not record that something in the service is actually not ideal. For that reason I would recommend setting client timeouts higher than service timeouts (if you are aware of them).<p>However there is yet another exception to this thing, which are TCP connection timeouts. If you can configure them separately, it makes sense to have those rather low and performing multiple retries. That can improve overall latency, since dropped SYN packets will only be retried by the OS after 1s."

"The Xbox Scorpio SoC is RX480 again, Polaris chip on steroids - coupled with more GDDR5 6.8GHz@326GB&#x2F;s BW vRAM 12GB with reserved to OS @1.5-2GB Plus a quad core Jaguar cluster added in with Vapor Chamber &amp; full DX12 HW improvements.

"&quot;I don&#x27;t know enough about mechanics to make a proper assessment of this, but my bullshit detector is bleeping, though shyly.&quot;<p>Mine too…<p>One of the fundamental problems regular wind turbines need to deal with is the &quot;V cubed&quot; term in the power contained in moving air. For exactly the same reason that you need eight times as much power to make a car go twice as fast – if you build a turbine that can produce it&#x27;s &quot;nominal power&quot; output in, say, 10m&#x2F;s (~22mph) of wind, it&#x27;ll need to be able to somehow deal with the turbine operating at 8 times nominal at 20m&#x2F;s (45mph, a not unreasonable occasional windspeed in many places) and 27 times nominal power at 30m&#x2F;s (a high, but certainly not yet &quot;beyond reasonable safety design limits&quot; speed).<p>My problem is with the numner on their Field Data page - they say they get an average &quot;speed Ratio&quot; of 1.8, and their turbine is rated at &quot;600W at 12.5m&#x2F;s&quot;. Ballpark extrapolation follows. I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s 12.5m&#x2F;s at the turbine, or 12.5&#x2F;1.8 = ~7m&#x2F;s wind speed. About 15mph. At half that windspeed, there&#x27;s 8 times less energy available, so 7.5mph of breeze will generate 75W, halve it again and output at 4mph drops down under 10W, and 2mph means low single digit Watts of output.<p>Now think about what happens to their turbine in a stiff breeze of 30mph? Where does the 4.8kW go? and when the once-in-5-years 60mph storm comes through, somewhere the best part of 40kW needs to be dealt with.

"For one thing, the X-37 Wikipedia page states that a design goal was 3.1 KM&#x2F;s Delta-V. That&#x27;s about as official a number as I&#x27;m finding online (blah blah Wikipedia source), but there are quite a few people who track these things in the sky. Each orbital inclination or altitude change requires a minimum delta V to execute, and we can observe the results of these maneuvers here on Earth. Online arguments about the X-37 delta-V are inconclusive, we&#x27;ll leave it at that!"

"Back in the 90s I use to install 2 way Earth Stations for Hughes.  An Earth station is basically a box that puts TCP&#x2F;IP over Satellite.  They are installed in many gas stations in the US.  If you drive down the street and see a white dish on the roof, chances are my company did the install ;)  These links handle credit card transactions for paying at the pump and they also handle lottery purchases.<p>The industry wasn&#x27;t regulated very much until a situation in which some installers aiming dishes for EDJ (Edward Jones Financials) were knock things off line by aiming dishes at wrong satellites.  I don&#x27;t know much about how the technology works but it became apparent that aiming a dish at the wrong &quot;bird&quot; as we call them could interfere with others.<p>The EDJ thing was big news back in the day although a google search turns up nothing.  It reportedly knocked Edward Jones off line for something close to a week while many were deployed to go and re-aim satellite dishes.<p>After this incident, the FCC got more involved and now to install a two way satellite dish, you have to take a course and pass it.  My whole team was required to go through this training.<p>We also installed 2 way satellite internet for a company out of Canada that had a PCI card you plugged into your PC.  The PCI card would then connect to the dish transmitter and LNB.  The down speed was around 4-5Mb&#x2F;s while the up speed was very slow at around 128Kb&#x2F;s.  I forget the name of the company but they had a proprietary driver for the PCI card that compressed the TCP packets in order to deal with the huge latency of traveling up to space and back down.  They also had patents on a modified TCP&#x2F;IP stack whereby they could locally ACK outbound TCP packets to improve throughput (as it was explained to me at the time)."
The exhaust velocity in a xenon ion thruster is 20-50 km&#x2F;s. Most of the time it’s on an earth escape trajectory (~11 km&#x2F;s in low orbit).

"Hmmm, that is a relatively high delta-v to change inclination that much (~1.5-2 km&#x2F;s for a ~12-15 degree difference). On the other hand, if the shared payloads are light enough (and they very well may be, particularly if the launch is undersubscribed), the upper stage could do the orbital transfer and should have plenty of delta-v to do so (particularly with a droneship landing) considering F9 regularly does recoverable flights with many tons through 2.5km&#x2F;s above LEO."
"Unless I&#x27;m misreading something, both the text and graphic of that page seem to indicate it&#x27;s 4.1km&#x2F;s from low Mars orbit to the surface of Mars.  I can&#x27;t find anywhere saying it&#x27;s 4.1 from LEO."

"In the real world TCP window scaling solves latency induced delays for video streaming in all but the most extreme cases (hence my caveat), and endpoint buffering can solve even those.<p>For many activities on the internet a 1,000ms latency would be intolerable, but for one-way video streaming it&#x27;s unnoticeable to the end user.  I don&#x27;t really care if a packet containing video takes 50ms or 1000ms to get from the CDN to my TV, as long as it gets there and is reasonably consistent in it&#x27;s ability to do so.<p>For this use case, if my machine can get 20Mb&#x2F;s on the test, latency will just not affect me streaming a 10Mb&#x2F;s video. Latency may be lowering my test results, but that&#x27;s the point here - testing the effective throughput."
"12 or 20 transactions per second? Let me regale you with a story from my youth... Once upon a time, it was 1985 and I worked at a  company that developed a “Transaction Processor”. A multiprocessor CP&#x2F;M system, with a “4th Generation” integrated app development language, a data store with an mathematician-optimized b-tree indexing system, paired with the fastest 120MB drives we could find through a series of phone calls and sample evaluations. It would be considered a proto-server by today’s standards. We were so proud at Comdex, bragging about 60 t&#x2F;s to anyone passing by.<p>We had a gentleman visit our booth from one of the big 4 airlines. He asked us what we were going to do to get to 1800 t&#x2F;s, because that was the load requirement for the reservation system he and his division were tasked with creating, deploying and maintaining.<p>I’m fairly certain a currency system needs to scale beyond what a single airline needs in terms of transactions per second."

"audiotool is made with Flash. And a good demonstration of the actual usefulness of Flash to develop complex applications that could be deployed online. Too bad Adobe was incapable of taking good care of that product and didn&#x27;t listen the community.

Changing anything in the patterns stops all sounds and the sequencer has hard time keeping a consistent  tempo.

"No need for &#x2F;s. That&#x27;s a valid concern that gets mentioned often in discussions like this.<p>If a biometric sensor can be tricked by a body part that is no longer attached to the body, that&#x27;s a serious issue. But AFAIK at least modern sensors try to verify if it&#x27;s still alive and then there&#x27;s also the biological effect that a body part quickly changes its properties if it is no longer supported by the body.<p>The biggest danger in that is probably criminals who don&#x27;t know that it is likely that a detached body parts stops functioning."

It is designed for this.<p>By analogy it&#x27;s like pointing out that an off-road jeep is sufficient to get anywhere on Earth, even with only a 300 mile range, because jeeps can carry supplies and&#x2F;or an extra tank of gas as its cargo instead of people, with staging outposts (gas &amp; maintenance stations) setup and supplied every few hundred miles."
