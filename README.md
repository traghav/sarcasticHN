# Snarky Hacker News

Identifying sarcasm is a a really hard problem for computers (and sometimes humans). Some good folks on the internet have been terminating the comments with a '/s' to denote a sarcastic quip. 

I have extracted all such comments from the Hacker News public data-set. Feel free to use it for something fun (I am trying to feed it to GPT-3 to see what comes out from the other end). Would love to know how you use it, please drop me a line -- hello@raghav.cc



## Here are some choice comments:

> You should really look into PHP then. Lots of like minded people with such organised and neat code./s

> Didn't you hear? Medium pays per clap now, so the NYT authors are all jumping ship /s

> Did you know that the initial rank at chess is grandslave? /s

> Google would never politically bias their service  /s

> With infinite scroll, there is no bottom line. /s
